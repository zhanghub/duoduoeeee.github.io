REMEMBER
Don't wait for what you want to come to you,
Go after it with all that you are.
Knowing that life will meet you halfway,
Don't feel like you've lost.
When plans and dreams fall short of your hopes,
Anytime you learn something new
About yourself or about life,
You have progressed.
Don't do anything that takes away from your self-respect;
Feeling good about yourself is essential to feeling good about life.
Don't ever forget how to laugh or be too proud to cry.
It is by doing both that we live life to its fullest.
