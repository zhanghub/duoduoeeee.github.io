SEOUL -- South Korea has launched the process of providing land to the US forces stationed to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korean soil, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

首尔——韩国外务省声称，已开始向驻韩美军供地，以便美国在韩国领土部署其战区高空防御导弹系统（人称“萨德”）。

Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a regular press briefing that the land provision procedure was launched according to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the two allies.
Lotte Group, South Korea's fifth-largest family-controlled conglomerate, inked a contract with the Defense Ministry of South Korea on Tuesday to exchange its golf course in the country's southeast region for military land near Seoul.

韩国外务省发言人赵俊赫在一次例行新闻发布会上声称，根据韩美两国同盟达成的军事现状协议，供地的进程已经启动。韩国第五大家族财团乐天已于周二与韩国国防部签订合约，将其所拥有韩国东南部地区靠近首尔的高尔夫球场改作军事用地。

Seoul and Washington abruptly announced a plan in July last year to deploy one THAAD battery in South Korea by the end of this year.

韩美两国于去年 7 月突然宣布了一项计划，要于今年年底前在韩国部署一处用于萨德系统的电池。

The THAAD site was changed in September into the Lotte-owned golf course, just a day after the rejection of a warrant to arrest Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin over alleged corruption.

（去年）9 月，萨德的部署地点被改为由乐天所有的高尔夫球场，此事发生的时间正是乐天集团主席辛东斌以所谓“腐败”为由的逮捕令被驳回的第二天。

The land swap deal between Lotte and the South Korean military is expected to speed up the remaining process of the THAAD deployment, such as the land provision, the basic designing of the base and the evaluation of environmental effects.

乐天集团和韩国军方换地的交易进度，预计萨德部署的后期会加快。例如供地、反导基地的初步设计、环境影响评估等等。

The spokesman said the final conclusion will be reached while reviewing the remaining procedures such as the environmental evaluation and other procedures relevant to the land provision.

发言人还宣称，随着对剩余过程（诸如环境评估以及相关其他步骤）的梳理，他们将得出最后的结论。

Cho said the THAAD deployment was decided from the perspective of the US-South Korea alliance, adding that the principle of installing the THAAD battery by the end of this year will be maintained.

赵俊赫声称，作出部署萨德一事的决定，是考虑到韩美同盟。此外，他们也将坚持在年底前完成萨德电池安装这一原则。

Local media speculations say that the THAAD deployment could be completed between May and July.

当地媒体猜测，萨德部署完成的时间可能在（今年）五月至七月之间。

The fast push for the THAAD deployment in South Korea caused strong backlashes from residents living in the Seongju county and the Gimcheon city which borders the golf course.

韩国政府快速推进萨德部署，招致了紧邻该高尔夫球场的星州县和金泉市居民的强烈抵制。

The residents planned to file a lawsuit with a Seoul administrative court against Defense Minister Han Min-koo for the absence of collecting opinion from them before announcing and deciding on the US missile defense system deployment.

两地居民计划，将在首尔一处行政法院提起对韩国国防部部长韩民求的诉讼，理由是在公布和决定美国导弹防御系统的部署一事之前，没有听取他们的意见。

China and Russia have strongly opposed the THAAD installation in South Korea as it breaks regional balance and damages security interests of the two countries.

中俄两国已针对韩国部署萨德一事表示了强烈反对。因为它将打破地区平衡，损害中俄两国的安全利益。

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing Monday that China expresses firm opposition and strong dissatisfaction with the THAAD deployment in South Korea.

中国外交部发言人耿爽在周一的例行新闻发布会上表示，中国对在韩国部署萨德一事表示坚决反对和强烈不满。

China will take necessary measures to safeguard its security interest, while the United States and South Korea will have to bear all the resulting consequences, he said.

他说，中国将会采取必要的措施，保障自身安全利益，美韩两国将必须承担相应后果。
