Good morning everyone.

各位早上好。

I’d like to start by thanking Councillor David Harvey for the introduction and opportunity for me to speak today.

在开始之前，我想先行向大卫・哈维议员致谢，感谢他所作的开场介绍，感谢他今天给我这次演讲的机会。

I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to see for myself, the potential benefit for motorists – and to the wider economy - of this excellent smart parking project, which has attracted £200,000 government grant funding, and which the Department for Transport is taking forward in partnership with Westminster City Council and other key stakeholders.

我特别高兴能有这一机会亲自见证这一智能停车场项目给摩托车骑手——以及给更广泛的经济带来的潜在效益。这一项目现已筹集了 20 万英镑由政府担保的资金。交通部现也正推进与威斯敏斯特市议会，以及其他重要利益相关方面人士的合作。

This work further demonstrates this government’s commitment to working alongside industry to promote technology and innovation, and to maintain the UK’s position at the forefront of the digital revolution.

该项目也更加表明了我政府在推进工业产业的同时倡导科技创新的决心，还将巩固英国在数字化革命前沿的地位。

And on that, I am also pleased to announce today that we are funding 19 smart traffic management schemes including smart parking demonstrator schemes in Coventry, Luton, Milton Keynes and Oxfordshire - as well as a partnership project between Hounslow, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Westminster, which looks to improve electric vehicle parking by combining parking sensors with electric vehicle charging points to give drivers real-time information on available spaces where they can recharge.

在这方面，我今天也很高兴地宣布，由我们提供资金建设的智能交通管理方案（目前）已有 19 套，包括考文垂、卢顿、米镇以及牛津郡，此外就是由豪恩斯洛、哈默尔史密斯 - 富勒姆和威斯敏斯特共同参加的这一项目。本项目旨在通过将停车传感器和电动汽车充电桩结合，为车主提供空余充电桩的实时信息，改善电动汽车的停放（体验）。

The way we travel continues to change, and technology has a valuable role to play through co-operative intelligent transport systems.

我们出行的方式仍在发生变化，而科技在其中扮演不可或缺的角色，主要体现在联动式智能交通系统上。

By enabling communication between vehicles, traffic signals, roadside sensors - as well as with other vehicles - the resulting information can bring increasing benefits, both to road operators, in terms of improved network management, and to road users, through the information they need, in real-time, to make the most of their journey.

通过让车辆和交通信号、路旁传感器以及其它车辆互相通信，所得到的信息，其效益会持续增长。公路的运营者可将其用于改善道路网络管理；公路的使用者则可实时获取他们需要的信息，使其出行的效率最大化。

Cities face a common challenge of accommodating significant rising demand for transport over the next 20 years, boosted by continued population growth, while meeting challenging carbon reduction targets and delivering customer expectations of transport that is safer, cleaner and greener, less congested and more reliable.

在接下来的 20 年内，（我们的）城市都会面临交通运量需求显著增长的挑战。我们面临着人口持续增长的压力，还要实现紧张的碳减排目标，并满足用户对于交通出行更加安全、洁净、绿色、畅通、可靠的期望。

Technology and information have huge potential to generate innovative solutions in these urban areas, and deliver more joined up and seamless multi-modal solutions which make better use of customer time.

科技与信息化具有在这些城市提出创新解决方案的巨大潜力，并提供更为无缝一体的多方式交通，更好地利用客户的时间。

Effective use of technology is crucial to delivering this, but this is not an end in itself – and it needs to be used to address specific policy challenges. This project is an excellent example of just that.

技术的有效使用对于以上目标的实现至为关键。但这仅仅是个开始——它还应用于传达特定的政策挑战。本项目极为绝佳案例。

While there is no definitive evidence on the percentage, at any one time, of traffic circling while looking for a parking space, the knock on effects on congestion and emissions are obvious, not to mention the added stress this can cause. We’ve all been there.

虽然现在关于单次寻找停车位而产生的交通流量尚无确凿证据，但这一方案在治理拥堵和尾气排放的效果是显著的，更别提拥堵和尾气带来的压力了——我们都经历过这种压力。

Improving the parking experience can help to improve public acceptance of, and compliance with, parking restrictions that are so necessary to keep traffic flowing.

改善停车体验也有助于提高社会对停车位限制的接纳程度和遵守程度。要保证道路车辆的运转，对停车位的限制是十分必要的。

Having real-time mapping to direct us to an available parking space within a mobile app, that allows ‘one-click’ electronic payment, that activates when we arrive, and stops when we leave, could not have been imagined not so long ago.

实时停车位引导地图应用上线之后，还将提供“一键电子支付”功能——它会在我们停车时（自动开始）计费，离开时停止（计费）。这在不久之前还是无法想象之事。

And I am pleased to have seen the project go further by extending this case to taxi drivers, who face the similar problem of finding available taxi ranks. It follows that a smarter distribution of available taxis can only benefit pedestrians looking for a taxi.

我也很高兴能看到这一项目继续发展，将这一案例扩大到出租车司机。和大家一样，他们也有寻找停车位的问题。对于空出租车更为智能的分配，对打车的行人而言，也可算作功德一件。

Although ‘big data’ is the lifeblood of digital traffic management solutions, data gathering is, in itself, of little use. What matters is how this data is interpreted and used to gain a better understanding of travel patterns and behaviours.

“大数据”虽然是数字化交通管理方案的源泉，但数据的收集本身用处甚微。关键在于，对这些数据的解读和使用能否让我们对出行方式和出行行为有更好的理解。

I am therefore delighted to be able to present a prize this morning to the winners of Westminster’s Parking Hackathon which took place last week. This event has already yielded valuable lessons to enable a better understanding of parking use which will further inform policy on parking.

因此，我很高兴能在此为上周举办的威斯敏斯特停车方案“黑客马拉松”活动的冠军颁奖。这一活动为我们更好理解停车位的使用提供了宝贵经验，以后还能为我们在车位方面的决策提供信息。

With the high level of parking demand on their road network, I commend Westminster City Council for rising to the challenge and placing itself at the forefront of parking technology in the UK.

在此，我赞赏威斯敏斯特市议会迎接挑战，并在全英率先推进停车位技术的努力。

I wish you a successful session this afternoon, sharing this good work with local authorities from around the country, and I wish you continued success with this project.

祝愿你们下午活动顺利，并与各地政府分享你们努力的成果。也祝愿你们的这一项目在今后取得更大的成功。

I’ve seen today that technology really does have the potential to ‘make parking better’.

我今天亲眼所见，科技的确有潜力“让停车更美好”。

Thank you.

谢谢大家。
