填空题：中国股市在近几周内，**<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>__**</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>。

A.投资者的财富蒸发了2万亿美元

B.在数小时内震荡幅度达10%。

C.将上百万的股东吓了个半死

D.以上全部。

Yes, correct! The answer is "all of the above." China's stocks markets have been swinging wildly since the middle of last month. One minute shares are up 6%, the next they're down 5% and plunging into a bear market. The main Shanghai market lurched lower again Friday, losing 5.8% over an extremely volatile trading session.

是的，完全正确！答案是“以上全部”。自上月中旬起，中国的股票市场就经历着剧烈的震荡。股票一会涨达6%，一会又跌达5%，瞬间跳水由牛市转变为熊市。在周五，上海这一主要市场又遭突然下挫，在极其不稳定的一个交易时段内，市值减少了5.8%。

Here's what you need to know:

你需要知道以下事情:

1) First, relax -- at least for now. Unless you're reading this from China, you probably don't have much invested in these markets. Foreigners own just 1.5% of Chinese shares, according to Capital Economics. That number is growing, but only very gradually.

先放松——至少现在先别急。在这些市场中，你可能并未投资多少。——除非你身在中国。。据资本经济学（研究）公司（的数据），外国（投资者）仅仅持有了这些市场中1.5%的股份。这一数字是在增长，但是增长得十分缓慢。

2) For Chinese investors, however, it's been a very wild ride. The Shanghai Composite -- the world's third largest stock exchange if you add up the value of its companies -- has lost 24% since June 12. The bears are growling even louder on the smaller Shenzhen Composite, down roughly 30% in the same period.

然而对于中国投资者来说，这种震荡是相当疯狂的。全球第三大股票交易所——上海证券交易所（如果把它旗下的企业市值都算上的话）自6月12日以来，其内交易的股票市值已经蒸发了24%。在规模较小的深圳交易所，熊市程度更甚。其内的股票，在同期之内，跌了大约30%。

3) Right, but those markets are still up for the year? Yes, that's true. The sharp losses follow a long bull run. The Shanghai Composite is still up 20% since Jan 1.

是的。但是这些市场今年还是涨了啊？对，这是真的。熊市巨大的损失之后，紧接着就是一次强劲的牛市。与1月1日相比，上证中的股票还是涨了20%。

4) Still, there's a lot of pain out there, especially among retail investors. Just 10% to 12% of Chinese households own shares, but a wave of newbie investors have flooded into the market this year. Brokers opened four million new accounts in a single week in April, according to BlackRock.

但是，这一过程仍然伴随着巨大的痛苦，特别是对于那些零售行业的投资者。仅有10%~12%的中国家庭炒股，但是今年，大批新进投资者涌入了市场。BlackRock的数据显示，仅在四月的一周之内，交易所的新开户数就达到了400万个。

5) Analysts have come up with a bunch of theories to explain why the bubble burst. Here's the most compelling: Shares prices had got way ahead of economic growth -- now at its weakest since 2009 -- and company profits, which are actually lower than a year ago.

分析人士提出了不少理论解释这种泡沫破裂的现象。最令人信服的解释是，股票增长的速度大大快过经济的（实际）增长速度——现在的股票市场是自2009年以来最为虚弱的——企业盈利与去年相比实际也有所走低，这也是彼此彼此。

6) Particularly troubling is an explosion in margin trading. That's when investors buy stocks with borrowed money. When margin bets go sour, investors are forced to quickly pay back huge amounts of cash.

而最为棘手的问题则是“边际贸易”（通过中介借款购买股票的行为——见[http://www.investopedia.com/university/margin/margin1.asp](http://www.investopedia.com/university/margin/margin1.asp)）。当“边际赌注”（见[http://bet-types.com.au/margin-betting/](http://bet-types.com.au/margin-betting/)）出现问题时，投资者将不得不在短期内还回巨量现金。

7) Things could get much worse. According to Oxford Economics, shares may have to fall another 35% or so to bring them into line with long-term averages.

事情还可能更加恶化。牛津经济学杂志称，股票可能还会再跌大约35%，才能使得它们回到长期均衡的轨道上来。

8) Trouble in the stock market has the potential to ripple through the Chinese economy, the second biggest on the planet with trade ties to nearly every country. Another 30% fall would erase roughly $1 trillion in wealth. That could have a big impact far beyond China.

股票市场的问题有可能会影响整个中国经济——中国这一进行对外贸易的第二大经济体几乎联系着世上的每个国家。若是中国股价再下跌30%，会导致大约1万亿美元财富的蒸发。这会给其他国家带来巨大的冲击。

9) Beijing is worried and is trying to prevent panic. The central bank has already cut interest rates to a record low. Market regulators have tried to reassure investors by blaming "irresponsible internet hearsay" and critical commentaries for "disturbing market order."

北京对此十分担忧，并正在试图防止恐慌。中国央行已将利率降至有记录以来十分低的水平。市场的调节者试图将问题归咎为“不负责任的网络谣传”和“扰乱市场秩序”的批评家，帮助投资者重拾信心。

10) Regulators have also launched an investigation into possible market manipulation. Criminal cases will be referred to security authorities, they said.

同时，市场调节者也对可能存在的市场操纵的行为开始了调查。他们声称，若是具体情况涉及犯罪，将会将案件交由有关安全部门处理。

11) But official moves could simply pump more air into the bubble, risking an even bigger crash. Regulators further relaxed rules on margin trading Thursday.

但官方的举动可能仅仅是会增大泡沫，下次崩溃（破坏）更大的风险将会增大。在周四，市场的调节者再次放宽了边际贸易的规则。

Who gets burned when China's stock bubble bursts?

China's stock market is now worth over $10 trillion
