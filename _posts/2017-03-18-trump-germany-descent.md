---



When Fred Trump was 11 America entered the first world war and a period of intense anti-German sentiment followed, abating in the interwar years and then flaring up again during the second world war.

> 弗雷德·特朗普11岁时，美国卷入了第一次世界大战，美国民众中的反德情绪也随之高涨，这种情绪在两次世界大战之间有所缓和，但在第二次世界大战期间卷土重来。

German books were burnt, sauerkraut was renamed “liberty cabbage” and frankfurters became “hot dogs”. 

> 美国人焚烧了德国的书籍，并把酸菜更名为“自由白菜”，把法兰克福熏肠叫做“热狗”。

Friedrich died of Spanish flu in 1918 at the age of only 49 and left Fred and his mother a tidy sum of money, which they used to set up a company, E. Trump & Son, and invested in property.

> 弗里德里希于1918年死于西班牙流感，年仅49岁。他留给了弗雷德和他母亲大笔遗产，他们用这笔钱成立了一家名叫E.特朗普父子的公司，同时也投资了房地产。

After graduation from high school in 1923, Fred started to work full-time in construction.

> 1923 年，弗雷德高中毕业后开始全职在建筑行业工作。

He realised quickly that his German origins could be a hindrance, so he pretended that his parents were Swedish, though his mother spoke English with a thick German accent and baked Apfeltorte for family reunions.

> 他很快意识到，他的德国出身可能是一个障碍，所以他对外佯称他的父母是瑞典人，尽管他的母亲讲的英语带有浓厚的德国口音，并且在家庭聚会时烘焙 Apfeltorte（德语，意为“苹果馅饼“）。

Donald was Fred Trump’s favourite child, and followed him into the building business.

> 作为特朗普弗雷德最喜欢的孩子，唐纳德跟着他父亲从事了建筑生意。

 “Fred taught Donald a lot and he was a very good student,” says Gwenda Blair, the author of a book on three generations of Trumps.

> “弗雷德倾囊相授，唐纳德也天赋异禀。” 作家 Gwenda·布莱尔说道，他的书讲述了特朗普家族三代人事迹。

Part of Donald Trump’s success in the casino and property business was down to his early understanding of the power of branding. “Trump” lends itself to big lettering on buildings because it suggests luck and success.

> 唐纳德•特朗普早期对于品牌力量的理解，使得他在赌场和地产业务上取得了不菲成绩，也正是因为如此，他才把“特朗普”的巨大字体烙在他的大楼上，因为它暗示着好运和成功。

Like his father, though, he thought his German origins might not endear him to possible backers.

> 不过，就像他的父亲一样，他认为他的德国出身可能不会讨好他的潜在支持者。

He stuck to Fred’s tale and wrote in his autobiography, “Trump: The Art of the Deal”, that his father was of Swedish descent. Challenged on this point in an interview with Vanity Fair in 1990, he replied: “My father was not German; my father’s parents were German…Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe.”

> 对于弗雷德故事中的说辞，他坚决不改口，并在他的自传《特朗普：交易的艺术》中写道，他的父亲是瑞典血统。在1990年《名利场》做的一场采访中，当主持人质疑这一点时，他回答说：“我的父亲不是德国人；我父亲的父母是德国人......瑞典人，真的是欧洲各地的那种。”
