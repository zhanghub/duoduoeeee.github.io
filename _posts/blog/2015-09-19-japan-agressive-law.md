Tokyo--(CNN)Japan's upper chamber of Parliament early Saturday approved controversial bills allowing the country's military to engage in overseas combat in limited circumstances -- a major shift after seven decades of pacifism.

CNN东京——日本参议院在周四的早些时候批准了一项受到争议的法案。该法案允许日本自卫队在特定条件下参加海外战斗——这是在日本奉行70年和平主义政策之后的主要转变。

The 148-90 vote was the final hurdle for the measures, which will go into effect within roughly the next six months. The lower parliamentary chamber passed the bills in July.

148票对90票的投票结果成为了这项法案在接下来将近6个月中开始施行的最终障碍。日本众议院于7月通过了这项法案。

The legislation reinterprets Article 9 of the Japan's pacifist post-World War II constitution, which outlaws war as a means of settling international disputes. The reinterpretation will now allow the Japanese military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, to defend its allies in a limited role in conflicts abroad.

此次立法重新解释了日本二战后和平宪法的第九条——第九条将“以战争手段解决国际争端”列为非法。新的解释允许日本军队——叫做日本自卫队——在日本盟国陷入与外国争端时以有限的角色进行防卫。

Japanese troops operating overseas had previously been limited to humanitarian roles.

而在此之前，日本军队在海外的行动仅仅扮演人道主义的角色。

Article 9 of Japan's constitution says, in part, "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes."

日本和平宪法第九条规定，“由于对正义与秩序下的和平抱有诚挚的向往，日本人民永远放弃国家政权所拥有的（发动）战争的权力，并放弃使用武力或武力威慑作为解决国际争端的方式。”

The bills, championed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, sparked fierce and vocal opposition, with massive demonstrations in Tokyo streets in recent months and physical altercations in parliament this week.

这项由日本首相安倍晋三牵头的法案引起了愤怒而强烈的抗议。近几月来，东京街头出现了大规模的示威活动，在本周议会上还出现了肢体冲突。

A scuffle broke out Thursday as opposition lawmakers in a special committee of the Upper House attempted to delay a vote. But the bill ultimately passed the committee, setting the stage for Saturday's vote.

周四，反对此法案的议员们在参议院的一个特别委员会内试图推迟投票时，（与法案支持者）爆发了扭打。但该法案在委员会内最终通过，不得不进行周六的投票。（？）

## The argument for the bills

**支持该法案的观点**

Supporters of the legislation, including top U.S. officials, say Japan needs to expand the role of the SDF to counter potential threats from nations such as China and North Korea. Both continue to develop their military and nuclear weapons programs.

此次立法的支持者，包括美国的高级官员，说日本应该强化其自卫队的角色，以应对来自例如中国和朝鲜等国的潜在威胁——这两国都在继续开发其军队和核武项目。

Earlier this month, China staged its largest military parade ever to celebrate 70 years since Japan's World War II defeat. Beijing remains locked in territorial disputes with multiple Asian neighbors in the East and South China seas.

本月的早些时候，中国举行了其最大规模的阅兵式，纪念抗日胜利70周年。中国与多个亚洲邻国之间还陷入了东海和南海的领土争端。

On Tuesday, North Korea warned the United States and its allies that it is ["ready to use nuclear weapons "at any time"](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/north-korea-nuclear-program/index.html) and is expected to launch a new satellite using a long-range rocket sometime in the coming weeks.

在周二，朝鲜警告美国及其盟国称其[“准备好在任何时间使用核武器”](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/north-korea-nuclear-program/index.html)，并且应会在接下来几周内的某日使用长程火箭发射一枚新的卫星。

Tokyo has faced growing international pressure to expand the role of its military, including deployment, to [defend the interests of its key allies, including the United States.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/27/politics/united-states-japan-defense-relationship/) America is bound by treaty to defend Japan, an agreement that has been in place since 1960.

日本正面临日益增加的国际压力，这使其不得不强化其军队的角色，从军队部署，到[保卫其关键盟国的利益，包括美国。](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/27/politics/united-states-japan-defense-relationship/)按照1960年就有的（美日安保）条约，美国是一定会保卫日本的。

"Japan is like the 42-year-old kid still living in the basement of the United States," said longtime Asia strategist Keith Henry.

亚洲长期策略家基斯亨利说：“日本就像一个42岁的，还活在美国基地里的小孩一样。”

Henry's Tokyo-based consulting firm, Asia Strategy, provides governmental policy analysis. Henry likens the defense bills to Japan finally "growing up" and moving beyond vague concepts of peace and democracy that are no longer practical given today's rapidly changing geopolitical landscape.

亨利的咨询公司“亚洲战略”主要研究日本问题，为政府提供战略分析。他把日本的这项法案比作日本终于“长大了”，越过了“和平”“民主”的模糊概念——这些概念在当今飞速变化的地缘版图之下，已经不实用了。

Henry says Japan is assuming a more proactive role in regional security, in part to offset China's growing military might.

亨利说，日本正假设自己在地区安全方面是一个更为先发制人的角色，这主要是为了与中国日益增长的军事实力相抵。

"Japan is moving out of the house of the U.S. that was essentially built after World War II," Henry said. "But there are risks involved in protecting one's national self interests."

“日本已经从美国二战后出于必要为其建的‘家’里搬了出去，”亨利说，“但是它得要保护自身的国家利益，这会牵扯到风险。”

## The argument against

**反对此法案的观点**

Those potential risks have triggered outrage on the streets of Tokyo. Opponents of the legislation say seven decades of Japanese postwar pacifism are simply being tossed away without proper public debate or discourse. They worry about the consequences of potentially sending troops into battle without actual combat experience.

这些“潜在的风险”已经导致了东京街头的愤怒。反对立法的人说日本战后七十年的和平主义甚至没有经过辩论或者正式的讨论就被简单抛弃了。人们担心在没有实战经验的情况下有可能将部队送上战场的后果。

Tens of thousands of anti-war demonstrators have been gathering in recent weeks outside the Japanese Parliament building -- the largest demonstrations of their kind in Japan in more than 50 years. They are students and teachers, workers and retirees, grandchildren and grandparents.

近几周内，成百上千的反战示威者在日本议会大楼外集会——这是50多年以来最大规模的示威活动。示威者中，有学生、老师、工人和退休人员，还有孙子孙女和爷爷奶奶。

Some wear work attire or school uniforms. Others have T-shirts, bandanas, or posters with spirited slogans like "No war! No Abe!" -- a message to the Prime Minister, who has grown increasingly unpopular in recent months for doggedly pushing the controversial security bills through parliament.

一些人穿着工装或者校服。还有些穿着T恤，围着巾帕，上面写着激烈的口号，比如“不要安倍！不要战争！”——这是写给首相看的——首相安倍近几月来固执地要国会通过这些有争议的安保法案，使得他的支持率一路走低。

Abe's face appears on posters with a Hitler-style mustache and Nazi swastika drawn on his forehead. The symbolism is clear. Some of these demonstrators view their Prime Minister as a dictator.

在海报上，安倍的脸被画上了希特勒式的小胡子，额头上画着纳粹的万字标志。这信号十分清楚。示威者当中，有些人就将他们的首相看做是独裁者。

Kazuo Shii, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party and Abe's political opponent, used a loudspeaker to rev up the crowd on Monday evening.

Kazuo Shii是日本共产党的主席，同时也是安倍的政敌。在周一晚上的活动中，他拿着扩音器，让人群亢奋起来：

"We fight, fight and fight through it! And abolish these unconstitutional security bills," Shii shouted as the crowd cheered.

“我们要抗争，抗争，战斗到底！废除那些违宪的安全法案！”Shii喊道，台下满场欢呼。

Hidenori Shida, a 65-year old IT engineer, said he's frightened by the idea that a Japanese bullet might someday kill someone overseas.

Hidenori Shida是一名65岁的IT工程师。他说，一枚日本子弹在某天很有可能打死一个海外的人，这想想都觉得害怕。

"Japan is a country which pledged not to fight a war again," he said. "We have killed no one in the (past) 70 years. This bill is unforgivable."

“日本曾保证，不再发动战争，”他说，“（过去的）70年我们可一个人都没害。（侵略战争）的债是无法原谅的。”

## Sweeping government powers?

**“横扫政府的力量”？**

While the security legislation may strengthen Japan's ties with its allies, Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University, warns it also gives "very sweeping powers to the government," which could allow logistic support and assistance to allied countries during wartime.

Sophia大学教授Koichi Nakano警告称，此项安全立法虽然可能会加强日本与其盟友的联系，但是也可能会有“横扫政府的力量”。它会使得日本在战时向结盟国提供后勤保障。

He said that Abe's administration has rushed discussion of the security legislation, and that the public "demand(s) the government to slow down so that people get a better understanding of what is happening."

他还说安倍的这种管理，掀起的是对于安全法案的仓促讨论。他说，公众要求的是让政府慢一点儿，让人们更好地理解发生的事情。

Opposition to the move is clearly evident in opinion polls. [A recent poll](http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201509140020) carried out by Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun indicated that 54% of respondents opposed the legislation, while 29% supported the bills. Three-quarters of respondents said parliamentary debate on security bills has been insufficient.

从民意调查中可以明显地看出人们对日本政府这一行为的反对。最近，日本朝日新闻进行的[民意调查](http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201509140020)显示，投票的人中，54%反对此法案，29%的人表示支持。四分之三的参与者表示，对于安全法案而言，仅有国会辩论是不够的。

## Economic Cost?

**经济成本？**

There is also concern about the potential impact of the legislation on Japan's defense budget, at a time when the nation is struggling with a crippling national deficit and chronic economic stagnation.

人们也担心此次立法对日本国防预算的潜在影响——国家在有害的财政赤字和长期的经济停滞中挣扎。

A stronger U.S. alliance and the expansion of SDF missions could force increases in defense spending. Japan's Ministry of Defense submitted a 5.09 trillion yen ($41.7 billion) request for budget allocations for the coming fiscal year, a 2.2% increase from 2015.

与美国更强的结盟和自卫队职能的强化，会使得政府不得不增大国防开支。日本防卫省为下一财政年申请的国防预算是5.09万亿日圆（约417亿美元），比2015年的预算上涨2.2%。

The increased spending could continue to bolster the Japanese defense industry, which received a boost after Abe did away with a self-imposed ban on exports of weapons and military hardware dating back to the 1960s.

增加的开销会继续刺激日本的国防工业，在安倍于上世纪60年代废除日本自愿承担的武器与军事设施出口禁令之后，国防工业受到了莫大的推动。

The changes allow Japanese defense companies to sell to new markets. Analysts say they also allow Japan to become more proactive in its own defense, a move welcomed by the United States but widely criticized by Abe's political opponents and sections of the general public.

废除这一禁令使得日本国防企业开拓新的市场。分析师指出，这也使得日本自身的防卫（政策）更为积极。该行为受到美国的欢迎，但是受到安倍的政治对手和公众的广泛批评。
