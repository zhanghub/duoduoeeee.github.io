<p class=lead>Just five years after the first 4G smartphone hit the market, the wireless industry is already preparing for 5G.</p>

**无线产业已经在为5G做出准备，而第一部4G手机上市销售其实只是五年之前的事情**

Each of the four nationwide cell phone carriers, as well as smartphone chipmakers and the major network equipment companies are working on developing 5G network technology for their customers.

美国国家级的四大运营商，以及智能机芯片厂商和网络基础设施企业正努力为客户研发5G网络技术。

There are many significant hurdles that all the industry players have to clear before you'll see a little 5G symbol next to the signal bars on your smartphone screen. For example, it has yet to be determined what 5G even means, let alone what it will look like and when it will get here.

但是你现在在你手机上还不能看见那个小小的5G图标，因为这些企业还得清除一些重大的障碍。比如，现在连5G这个概念还没确定下来，更别说它长什么样子以及什么时候能用这样的问题了。

But as consumers use up rapidly growing amounts of 4G bandwidth watching streaming videos on their phones, 5G will soon become a necessity. As telecom engineers work furiously to develop 5G technology, we're getting a clearer picture of the who, what, where, when and why of 5G.

但是由于我们消费者现在拿手机看视频，4G流量越用越多，5G还是会变成必备的。由于电信工程师开发5G的进展很快，我们面前有关5G的蓝图也愈加清晰。

##What is 5G?

**5G是个啥？**

The "G" in 3G, 4G and 5G stands for "generation." So 5G will be the fifth generation of wireless network technology.

3G、4G和5G当中，G表示“代”的意思。所以5G就是我们无线网络技术的第五代。

The standards for 5G have not yet been set. According to Bill Smith, president of AT&T's (T, Tech30) network operations, 5G will likely be defined in 2018, and the standards for 5G will codified sometime in 2019 by the standards-setting International Telecommunication Union, a branch of the United Nations. The standards will determine which wireless technologies can be called "5G," as well as what its characteristics must include, such as how fast it will be.

5G的标准目前尚不明确。据AT&T网络运营部的主管Bill Smith所言，5G的概念很有可能会在2018年确定下来，5G的标准将会在大概2019年年内由国际电信联盟制定——这是联合国的一个分支机构。该标准将会确定，哪种无线技术可以被叫做5G，同时还会给出5G必须包含的特性，比如它的速度是多少。

Still, it's possible to make a very educated guess about what 5G will look like based on the emerging 5G technologies that the wireless industry is experimenting with.

但是，我们还是可以根据我们目前无线领域正在快速推进的5G技术（的现状），来一个很合理的推测。

Here's the elevator pitch: 5G will be faster, smarter and less power-hungry than 4G, enabling a slew of new wireless gadgets. 5G will let us have faster smartphones, more smart-home devices and longer-lasting wearable gizmos.

先总的说下吧：与4G相比，5G将会更快速，更智能，也更省电。新一批无线设备将会支持该标准。5G将使我们的手机、智能家居设备的速度更快，更可延长我们可穿戴设备的电池寿命。

##How fast will 5G be?

**5G会有多快？**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150908113155-4g-vs-5g-780x439.jpg)

5G has the potential to offer speeds up to 40 times faster than 4G -- fast enough to stream "8K" video in 3-D or download a 3-D movie in about 6 seconds (on 4G, it would take 6 minutes).

5G有比4G速度快40倍的潜力——这样的速度足以缓冲8K的3D高清视频，或者在6秒内下完一部3D电影（在4G环境下下完的时间是6分钟）。

Unfortunately for consumers, there's a difference between lab experiments and reality. Peak speeds are fun to dream about, but in the real world, actual speeds are much slower than promised.

而不幸的是，对于消费者来说，实验条件和现实环境还是有所区别的。峰值速度爆表，这想想倒有点意思，但是在现实当中，实际的速度比标称的要慢很多。

Nokia (NOK), one of the biggest 5G players, believes that its 5G technology will allow for real-world speeds of about 100 Megabits per second when the network is most congested -- that's about four times faster than 4G's top speed.

诺基亚是5G行业最大的厂商之一，他相信5G技术之下，在网络最为拥堵的时段，实际的速率可达每秒100MB——这速度大约比4G的峰值速度快4倍。

Another characteristic of 5G is that it will have ultra-low latency, meaning that it could drastically reduce the amount of time it takes for the network to respond to your commands. That could give the appearance of much faster loading websites, apps, videos and messages.

5G的另一个特性是，它的网络延迟将会非常低，这意味着网络相应你指令的时间急剧缩短。网页、应用、视频和信息的加载速度会快得多。

##How will it work?

**它的原理是怎样的？**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150318122744-cell-tower-780x439.jpg)

A lot of the wireless companies' 5G experimentation is taking place in super-high frequencies -- as high as 73,000 MHz. Today's cell phone networks broadcast signal in a range of 700 MHz to 3,500 MHz.

这些无线通讯厂商的5G实验当中，很多是在超高频之下进行的——频率达到73000MHz。而当今的手机网络广播信号，频率的范围为700至3500MHz。

The advantage of high-frequency signals is that they're capable of providing significantly faster data speeds. The disadvantage is that they travel much shorter distances and they can't easily penetrate walls. That means thousands -- perhaps even millions -- of mini cell towers, or "small cells" would need to be placed on top of every lamp post, every building, inside every home and potentially every room.

超高频信号的优势在于，数据传输的速度将会显著提高。而劣势则在于这样的信号传播的范围更为有限，并且不容易穿过墙壁。这意味着所有路灯杆上、楼顶上、每家每户甚至每个房间里得要装上总共成千上万甚至数百万的小型信号塔。

That presents a host of problems. How can cell phone companies possibly process all that data? There are companies, such as Google's recently acquired Alpental, that are working on those "backhaul" issues. But they're not so close to a solution, according to Akshay Sharma, wireless infrastructure analyst at Gartner.

这会带来一系列问题。手机厂商怎么可能处理所有这些数据啊？于是有公司出来处理这些所谓的“回程线路”问题了，比如谷歌最近才收购的Alpental公司。但是据Garter公司的无线基础设施分析师Akshay Sharma所言，他们离做出解决方案来还有距离。

That's why 5G might complement 4G, rather than outright replace it. In buildings and in crowded areas, 5G might provide a speed boost. But when you're driving down the highway, 4G could be your only option -- at least for a while.

所以说，5G可以作为4G的一个补充，而不是简单地替代它。在人群密集的建筑物内，5G可能会起到加速的作用。但是若你是在高速路上行驶，4G则可能是你唯一的选择。——或者至少是一时不得不选择。

When is 5G coming?

**5G什么时候来啊？**

![](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151204122447-5g-780x439.jpg)

None of these questions are going to be answered any time soon. The industry's consensus is that it will run 5G experiments in South Korea during the 2018 Winter Olympics, with mass deployments beginning sometime in 2020.

这类的问题，很快就会有答案了。整个行业的共识是，在2018年的韩国冬奥会上，他们将会进行5G的实验，而大规模部署工作则会在大概2020年开始。

Yet Verizon (VZ, Tech30) has said that it is working on 5G technology with the aim of bringing it to market much sooner -- as early as 2017.

而Verizon已表示，他们正在研究5G技术，目标是在更早的时候就将其实现商用——大概在2017年。

With all the questions surrounding 5G and all the wrinkles that need to be ironed out, it's exceedingly unlikely that anything Verizon does will be widely deployed. For example, the smartphone makers will need to develop chips that are capable of sending and receiving 5G signal without driving costs significantly higher.

由于围绕5G还有这么多问题，而且还有这么多小毛病得治，Verizon的成果要很快投入量产还特别不现实。比如，手机厂商得要开发出能收发5G信号的芯片，同时价格还得要能收住。
