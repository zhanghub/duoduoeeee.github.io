#8 Days in North Korea 朝鲜八日游

**Welcome to the world’s most isolated civilization**
**欢迎来到全球最封闭的文明**

In September 2015, I traveled to North Korea to see, first-hand, what life was like inside the Hermit Kingdom. Much of the country was what I had expected: strange, ersatz, thick with propaganda, and every so often, seriously unsettling.

在今年九月，我去了朝鲜旅游，以便亲眼见见这个封闭的王国里的生活是怎样的。这个国家的很多方面都如我所预料——有些奇怪，有些虚伪，有着大量的政治宣传，经常使人神经紧张。

And yet, the journey was also filled with some truly wonderful, completely unexpected surprises. One thing’s for sure: North Korea really is unlike any other place on Earth.

但尽管如此，这次旅行也的确有真正美好，完全意想不到的惊喜。有件事是肯定的：朝鲜和地球上的其它地方真心太不一样了。

Since my return, I’ve had a lot of people, friends and strangers, ask me about my trip. There has been way more curiosity about North Korea than I would have imagined — so much so, that I thought I’d write down some of my experiences, and share them with you here.

我回国之后，就有好多人，朋友啊，陌生人啊，问我这次旅行的事情。美国人对朝鲜的好奇程度远远超过我的想象。这些问题问得太多，于是我决定写下我的一些经历，在这里和你们分享。

Pictures and stories alone can’t do justice to what it’s really like being on the ground in North Korea. As a visitor, you’re watched 24/7, you have no freedom, and you’re constantly tense and on edge. But hopefully, this post will at least give you a glimpse into what life is like in one of the most restricted, enigmatic destinations in the world.

照片和故事的讲述，并不能够完全反映真正在朝鲜的经历。作为一个游客，你是被从早到晚监控着没有自由，你会一直处于紧张和焦虑的状态。但是我希望这篇博客可以让你们对这个严重受限的令人困惑不解的国家有一丢丢认识。

## Departure Day

**出发之日**

My journey began with mixed feelings of trepidation, excitement, and unbridled curiosity. With my visa in hand, I boarded North Korea’s national air carrier, Air Koryo — the lowest-ranked airline in the world, and the only carrier to have a one star safety rating with [SkyTrax](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3214053/Fasten-seatbelts-bumpy-ride-s-really-like-fly-North-Korea-s-Air-Koryo-worst-airline-world.html).

我的旅程伴着恐惧、激动、以及十二分强烈的好奇心开始了。手中拿着签证，我搭上了朝鲜的国营航空，叫做“高丽航空”的，这是全球评级最低的航空服务，其在[SkyTrax](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3214053/Fasten-seatbelts-bumpy-ride-s-really-like-fly-North-Korea-s-Air-Koryo-worst-airline-world.html)上的安全性评级只有一星级。

On board, we filled out a rather ominous customs declaration, where we were reminded not to bring in any killing devices, poison, “historical and cultural wealth,” “publishings of any kind,” or “cell phone and other communication means.” We were seriously about to go off the grid.

在飞机上，我们填写了一份不祥的海关声明书，这里面提醒我们不能带任何凶器、毒药、“历史与文化财富”、“任何种类的印刷出版物”，或者“手机及其它通信工具”。我们这真心是要人间蒸发的节奏。

We were fed a peculiar hamburger made from mystery meat, and subjected to our very first taste of North Korean propaganda.

机上给我们吃的是一种不知是拿啥肉做的奇异汉堡，同时还让我们先行体验了一把朝鲜的政治宣传。

Our in-flight magazine had articles with headlines like:

我们机上的杂志里有些文章，标题像这样：

<blockquote name="ee82" id="ee82" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">Local Elections Display the Invincible Might of DPRK Government
朝鲜地方人民会议议员选举展现了民主朝鲜战无不胜的威力</blockquote>

which referred to Kim Jong Un with a very official-sounding title that took up nearly a whole paragraph:

这里面提到了金正恩，加上了一堆非常官方的头衔，占了几乎一整段：

>Kim Jong Un, First Secretary of the WPK, First Chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army
>
>朝鲜劳动党第一书记、朝鲜国防委员会第一主席、朝鲜人民军最高统帅金正恩

Throughout the entire flight, TV monitors overhead played non-stop propaganda videos, featuring an all-female rock group called [Moranbong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moranbong_Band). These women are the North Korean equivalent of U2. Each band member was hand-picked by Kim Jong Un.

在整个飞行过程中，我们头顶上的显示器循环播放着宣传视频，视频里有个摇滚组合叫[牡丹峰乐团](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moranbong_Band)，全部由女性组成。这个乐队在朝鲜的地位等同于美国的U2。乐队的每名成员都由金正恩亲手挑选。

The video was apparently filmed live in a massive auditorium, filled with expressionless men all dressed in identical military uniforms, sitting stiff and upright. They all remained frozen in their seats, motionless, until an enormous image of Kim Jong Un was projected onto a giant screen behind the rock band, at which point, all the men would commence applauding robotically in unison. They wouldn’t stop clapping until the image came down.

很显然，视频是在一个大型礼堂里拍的，还是live版的。礼堂里面坐的都是穿着完全一样的军服的男人，他们面无表情地坐在那里，身子发直，一动不动，直到一个巨大无比的金正恩头像给拿投影机投到乐队背后的巨屏上的时候，所有人都会机械而整齐地鼓掌，头像不灭则掌声不息。

We were prohibited from taking photos or videos on the plane, but I did manage to sneak this short video when the stewardesses weren’t looking:

在飞机上拍照或拍视频是禁止的。但是，在那些空乘人员没注意的时候，我成功地拍下了这个短短的视频。

## Arrival

**抵达**

Pyongyang Airport was not at all what I had expected. The airport was relatively modern-looking and clean. I was a bit nervous going through passport control, but that turned out to be pretty uneventful.

平壤机场和我所想象的一点都不一样。整个机场相当的富有现代感，而且也很干净。在过护照检查的时候我有点紧张，但还好平安无事。

Everyone did have to go through special luggage screening in order to enter the country, and that’s where things got a bit more interesting.

确实，所有人都得经过特别的行李过滤才能进入朝鲜，在这里，事情开始变得有点意思了。

I was bringing a fair bit of photography equipment with me: two cameras, a portable hard drive, lens filters, a bunch of spare batteries, and lots of extra memory cards. Upon seeing all this camera gear, security guards pulled me out of line and escorted me to a walled off, secondary security area, where they closely examined all my equipment.

我带了相当多的照相设备：两个相机、一个移动硬盘、滤镜、一些备用电池以及好多额外的存储卡。一看见我带的这些照相器材，安全人员把我从队伍里揪了出来，把我夹在他们中间，带到了一个拿墙隔断的第二层安全区域，在那里他们仔细检查了我的所有设备。

I also had a smartphone and tablet with me, and had to hand these over for inspection. North Korea now records the serial numbers for all smartphones brought into the country. I watched as a security guard entered my devices’ digits into a log book, before he handed them back to me.

我还带了一个手机和一个平板，这些也得拿去检查。朝鲜现在会记录所有进入它国境智能机的序列号。我眼睁睁地看着一个安全员把我设备的序列号输到一个日志里，随后将设备归还了我。

The government is particularly paranoid about foreigners bringing in any kind of literature that could be used to influence their people (e.g., the Bible). Finding nothing offensive in my bags, or stored on my memory cards, I was finally permitted to enter the country.

朝鲜政府对外国人带入任何形式的文化作品甚为忌惮——它们会被用来影响朝鲜的人民（比如圣经之类的）。安全人员在我的包里和我的存储卡里没发现任何有侵犯性的东西，于是终于将我放行。

As it turned out, a lot of what I had previously read about North Korea was true. You are assigned government-trained “minders” who are with you 24/7. They monitor your activities, manage your itinerary, and tell you what you can and cannot do. You are in their custody for the entirety of the trip. There are always at least 2 minders assigned to a group, because the minders also have to mind each other, making sure their comrades don’t succumb to the devious devilry of us American imperialists. No joke.

正如结果所示，我之前读到的有关朝鲜的东西都是真的。朝鲜会给你指派经过政府训练的“监视员”，一天24小时看着你。他们会监视你的活动，管理你的行程，告诉你能做什么，不能做什么。整个旅程中，你都在他们的“监禁”之下。每个旅游团都会被指派至少两个监视员，因为监视员们也得要互相监视，以防他们的同志屈从于我们这些美帝国主义诡计多端的恶鬼。我说的真话。

## The Rules

**各种规则**

Before our shuttle had even left the airport parking lot, our minders were already beginning to walk us through all the rules we had to obey, including:

我们的车还没驶离机场的停车场之前，我们的监视人员就已经开始告诉我们各种必须遵守的规则，包括：

1. We must always travel in a group. For the entire trip, we almost never got to walk around outside. Instead, we were bused from place to place, even if we were only traveling 4 blocks. You’re definitely not allowed to do things like leave the hotel at night or explore the city on your own 我们必须始终结伴而行。在整个旅程中，我们几乎从未在室外走动过。与此相反，我们总是被塞在大巴里，从一个地方走到另一个地方，哪怕只需要走四个街区。有些事情你是绝对不准做的，比如在晚上离开酒店或者自己探索这座城市

2. No photos of military sites or soldiers. This often proved to be difficult, given that nearly 40% of North Korea’s population serves in the military 照片中不允许出现军事设施或者军人。实际操作中这经常很困难，因为朝鲜人口的大约40%都在军队服役

3. No photos of construction sites or any people at work. The government wants the world to see their country represented only by pristine pictures of perfection. Photographs of half-finished buildings and sweaty laborers apparently don’t make the cut 图片不准出现建筑工地或者正在劳动的工人。朝鲜政府想让世界看见表示它的图片都是新崭崭的，完美的那种。建到一半的建筑或者挥汗如雨的工人的照片明显不和谐

4. If you take pictures of any of their Dear Leaders, you have to capture their whole figure. You can’t crop out any part of their bodies 如果你要给他们那些尊敬的领导人拍照，你得拍到他们的全身像，不准把他们身体的任何部位排除在外

5. If you have any printed materials depicting the Dear Leaders (e.g., newspapers, magazine), you can’t crease their images. You also can’t throw these materials in the garbage, or use them as wrapping paper 如果你有任何描述敬爱领导人的打印材料的话（比如报纸、杂志），你不能把他们的画像弄皱了。你还不能把这些材料扔进垃圾桶，也不能用它们来包东西

6. Whenever you visit a statue of a Dear Leader, your group will need to line up single-file in front of it, and bow. Your hands must be at your side; not in your pockets or behind your back 无论何时拜见敬爱领导人的雕塑时，全旅行团必须在塑像之前排成一列纵队并向其鞠躬。你的两手必须贴在身侧，不准插口袋或者背在背后。

## The Facade

**粉饰太平**

The North Korean government begrudgingly welcomes only a handful of tourists into its country each year, and it does so with a tremendous amount of fear and distrust.

朝鲜政府每年只是十分吝啬地欢迎一小部分的游客到他们的国家，并且同时还抱有极大的恐惧和不信任。

<blockquote name="179b" id="179b" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">To cope with these foreign visitors, North Korea has constructed an elaborate facade, designed to make the country look prosperous and flourishing
为了对付这些外国游客，朝鲜费尽心思打造了虚伪的门面，使得国家看起来是繁荣昌盛的</blockquote>

Many of the sites we visited and interactions we had were blatantly staged. At times, the country’s attempts at portraying perfection were so contrived, it was comical. At other times, the fakery was just downright unsettling.

我们访问的很多景点还有我们进行的各种互动都受到公然的监视。有时候，朝鲜将自身描写得完美无缺的那种企图实在是机关算尽，都让人觉得好笑。而其它时候，这种粉饰则十分令人不安。

However, every so often, you come across a crack in the facade, and in that fleeting moment, you catch a glimpse into the real North Korea (or at least a slightly less fabricated version). For me, those were some of the most memorable moments of my trip.

但是，你每每会看见他们精心打扮下的破绽之处，而在那短暂的一瞬，你会瞥见真正的朝鲜（或者至少是稍稍真实了那么一点点的样子）。而那些瞬间，则成为我旅途中最为难忘的记忆。

Below, I’ll share some of those moments, and in doing so, do my best to present a balanced view of what I saw on my visit: the good and the bad, the outlandish and the beautiful, the pageantry and simple, ordinary life.

接下来，我会和大家一起分享这样的时刻。我会尽我所能地平衡我旅途之所见——好的方面和不尽如人意的方面；奇怪的事情和美好的事情；隆重的仪式和简单朴素的日常生活。

## Propaganda

**政治宣传**

The first thing you notice as soon as you pull out of the airport is the propaganda. It’s literally everywhere. Every street intersection, every building, every subway station, and even every subway car proudly displays portraits of the nation’s Dear Leaders. Banners and giant murals extol the virtues of North Korea and Kim Il Sung’s [Juche ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) around self-reliance.

离开机场，你看到的第一件物事便是宣传海报。这玩意基本上到处都是。各个十字路口、各个建筑、地铁站，甚至是地铁里的每个车厢，都甚为自豪地向你展示朝鲜伟大领袖的半身像。各种横幅和大型壁画满是赞美歌颂朝鲜功德以及金日成“自力更生”[主体思想](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche)的内容。

>Propaganda is everywhere in North Korea
>
>朝鲜的政治宣传随处可见

The country has propaganda vans trolling the streets with giant megaphones perched on their rooftops.

在朝鲜，会有那种顶上装着巨大喇叭的宣传车驶过街道。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vNAX68GAV5R9gvYPHpHVfA.jpeg)

Every morning, at 6:30am, you awake to the delightful wake-up call of propaganda music blaring into your windows from the streets.

每天早上六点半，你会被从大街上飞入屋子窗户里怡人的政治宣传音乐声唤醒。

>Early morning propaganda wake-up call
>
>大清早上叫你起床的宣传音乐

Even the people themselves are part of the propaganda machine. Nearly every North Korean wears a red pin patriotically emblazoned with the faces of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. I tried really hard to lay my hands on one of these pins, but tourists aren’t allowed to have them. They have to be earned through loyal servitude.

甚至这个国家的人民也是宣传机器的一部分。几乎所有朝鲜人都会戴一枚红色的胸针，上面刻有金日成和金正日的头像，十分具有爱国热情。我费了很大劲想弄到这样一枚胸针，但是游客是不能得到它的——得要经过忠诚服役之后才行。

>Everyone in Pyongyang wears a red pin with their Dear Leaders’ portraits
>
>平壤的每个人都戴着一枚红色胸针，上有他们伟大领袖的半身像

Even at work, there’s no escaping the propaganda. Factories, like this textile plant we visited, had propaganda posters plastered all over the inside and outside of the factory walls.

哪怕在工作场合，你也逃不开政治宣传。各种工厂，比如我们参观的这个纺织厂里，墙上里里外外到处贴的都是宣传海报。

>Propaganda inside and outside at North Korea’s largest textile factory
>
>朝鲜最大的纺织厂。厂子的里里外外贴满宣传画

What was perhaps scariest though, was the propaganda we found inside the nation’s schools. During our trip, we visited two schools: 1) a primary school in Pyongsong, a small, provincial city north of Pyongyang, and 2) the Children’s Palace, a school in the capital city for gifted children. What we saw on the walls of these institutions was disturbing — gruesome images of war, killing, and death, side-by-side with Disney-like portraits of the Dear Leaders adoring (and being adored by) children.

然而，最为可怕的事情估计是我们还在朝鲜的学校里发现了这种宣传画。我们全程访问了两所学校，一所是平城市的一所小学,平城市是朝鲜平壤北边的一个省级市；另一所是朝鲜少年宫，是朝鲜首都专为有天赋的小孩准备的。我们在学校的墙上看见的是令人不安和毛骨悚然的有关战争、杀戮以及死亡的图片，这些图片的旁边则是表现朝鲜领导人关爱孩子（以及受到孩子爱戴的画像），这些画像倒画得像迪士尼的似的。

On one of the war murals, the school administration had even covered up specific photos in advance of our arrival. Given how graphic the visible parts of the mural already were, I can only imagine what was hidden underneath. I asked our minder about these pieces of paper, and she sidestepped the question, saying that they were probably just touching up parts of the mural.

在其中一处战争壁画上，学校的管理人员甚至在我们来之前预先盖住了特定的一些图片。但由于我们能看见的图片已经是这样的，那被盖住的部分是什么，我也只能想象想象了。我就这个问题询问了我们的监视员，她绕过了这个问题，说它们可能只是用来润色壁画的那些部分的。

## Our Gilded Prison

**我们的监狱金碧辉煌**

Because we weren’t allowed to leave our hotels at night, we got to know our hotels very well. We called them our gilded prisons. Thankfully, all of these hotels had some type of bar, and, as it turns out, North Korean beer is really quite good. So, most evenings, we just relaxed at the hotel bar, and bonded with other adventurous travelers and a very select group of locals who’ve been pre-approved by the government to mingle with foreigners.

由于他们不允许我们晚上离开酒店，我们对我们的酒店十分了解。我们把它叫做我们金碧辉煌的监狱。而万幸的是，这些酒店都有某种类型的酒吧，而且我们发现，朝鲜的啤酒真心好喝。所以多数晚上，我们都会在酒店里放松休息，并与其他的探险游客交流，还与酒吧里非常少数的当地人交流，这些人都是被政府选中，预先得到批准才能和外国人待在一起的。

In Pyongyang, we stayed at the Koryo Hotel. It’s one of the top hotels in North Korea, and equivalent to a 3-star hotel in the US. There was a huge fire in this hotel just a couple months ago, and a few tourists were arrested for taking photos of that fire. I don’t know what became of them, but one thing was for sure though, I was going to have to be extra careful with my photography.

在平壤，我们住的是高丽饭店。这是朝鲜最顶级的酒店之一，相当于美国的一家三星级酒店。几个月之前，这里曾发生过一场大火，有几个外国游客就因为拍摄着火的照片而被捕。我不知道他们是咋撞在枪口上的，但是有一点可以确信，我拍照的时候可得特别小心。

The hotel lobby had this over-the-top, tacky Vegas feel to it, and the rooms were really dated. Here is a video tour I shot of the hotel:

酒店大厅的吊顶给人一种蹩脚的维加斯即视感，房间相当陈旧。下面的视频是我在酒店里边走边拍的：

The Koryo hotel is the second-largest in North Korea, and has 43 stories. That’s a lot of floors, particularly for a hotel that didn’t seem all that busy. I noticed that most of the guests were all clustered on just a couple of the floors. So, one night, I decided to go explore the other hotel floors. I found myself wandering around some really creepy, abandoned hallways that were completely pitch black. Check it out:

高丽酒店是朝鲜第二大酒店，有43层。有很多酒店用的楼层看起来并非是那么繁忙。我注意到大多数酒店客人都聚在那么几层。所以有一天晚上，我决定去探索一下其他的楼层。我发现这些楼层楼道都废弃了，完全是漆黑一片，令人毛骨悚然。你们可以看看：

## The Pyongyang Elite

**平壤精英**

Living in Pyongyang is like living in [The Capitol in The Hunger Games](http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/The_Capitol). Only the elite are allowed in. Out of the whole country, the propaganda here is the loudest, the love for the Dear Leaders is the most passionate, and life is as good as it gets in North Korea.

在平壤生活就像身处[饥饿游戏的国会大厦](http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/The_Capitol)里一样。只有精英才能进入。平壤这里的政治宣传是全国最重的，对伟大领袖的崇拜热情是最高昂的，生活水平也是朝鲜全国最高的了。

<blockquote name="2d76" id="2d76" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">If you’re living in Pyongyang, you are the 1%
如果你在平壤“生活”，你就是精英阶层</blockquote>

And with this status comes privilege that you won’t find elsewhere in the country:

而且你若是有了这种身份地位，你也会享有全国其他地区根本无从谈起的特权：

- You’re given free housing in high-rise apartments in return for loyalty and service to the country. 作为你对国家忠诚和付出的回报，你会免费分配到高层住宅楼里的住房。

- You have access to grocery stores that are stocked with Nutella, Oreos, Absolut Vodka, and… jelly shoes. Some of these pictures are a bit blurry, because you’re not allowed to take pictures inside any of the country’s stores. So, I had to get creative with my photography. 你可以去朝鲜的食品零售店买东西。里面有[能多益](http://baike.baidu.com/view/1061756.htm)（官网见：<http://www.nutellausa.com/>，译者注）、奥利奥、[绝对伏特加](http://baike.baidu.com/view/3103770.htm?fromtitle=Absolut+Vodka&fromid=3092452&type=syn)（官网见：<http://www.absolut.com/cn/>，译者注）还有……胶鞋。下面的一些图片可能会有些模糊，因为在店内拍照是不允许的。所以我拍照的时候不得不加波特技。

Products were arranged in perfect rows, and shelves were fully stocked. Everything was designed to show bountifulness and prosperity.

产品完美地排列成行，货架全部摆满。所有东西都经过精心设计，展示出富足繁荣的景象。

Notice in the top picture how many security cameras are hanging from the ceiling. There was more surveillance in this small grocery store than in my bank back home in the US.

注意到第一张图片上，商店的天花板上挂着多少摄像头。这家小小的杂货店里面的监控比我美国的银行都多！

Clearly, what we saw in Pyongyang was definitely not representative of what life is like for most North Koreans. But even still, this was better living than what I had initially expected to see in the city.

很明显，我们在平壤所见并不能代表普通朝鲜民众的生活。但尽管如此，这已经比我一开始对这所城市生活情况的期望值高了。

## A Soviet Concrete Jungle

**社会主义的水泥丛林**

Overall, Pyongyang was much more developed than what I had imagined.

从大体上看，平壤的发展状况比我想象的要好得多。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*yVZHDSdIM6Z3Ng7pVzcaSQ.jpeg)

>Pyongyang from above
>
>平壤鸟瞰图

Sure, most of the city was comprised of drab, Soviet-style buildings — hulking Lego blocks of faceless concrete. But the sheer scale of it all was greater than what I had anticipated.

当然，平壤的大部分都由单调的苏式建筑组成，这些建筑是那种缺乏个性的半完成的乐高积木块。而这种完全是钢筋水泥的面积还是大得超过了我的预料。

From afar, there were even parts of the city that were quite picturesque.

远看起来，平壤这座城市有些地方还挺上镜的：

>从[主体思想塔](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche_Tower)上俯瞰大同江

But that beauty quickly faded as you peered just a little bit more closely. Upon closer inspection, you find yourself staring at a cityscape that was all too often rickety and raw.

但是你若是稍稍凑近一点观察的话，这种美就会快速消失。如果你更仔细地审视的话，你所盯着的城市景观就通常会是摇摇欲坠，未经修饰的。

Abandoned construction sites littered the city, leaving Pyongyang pockmarked with ghostly scaffolds, and half-constructed buildings.

全城散布着废弃的建筑工地，使得平壤到处布满着阴森的断头台以及未完成的建筑。

>Abandoned construction sites in Pyongyang
>
>平壤废弃的建筑工地

Perhaps the most famous unfinished construction project is the [Ryugyong Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel), the tallest building in North Korea. Construction began in 1987, and the building remains unfinished and unopened to this day.

而最著名的未完成的建筑项目应该是平壤[柳京饭店](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryugyong_Hotel)，朝鲜最高的建筑。项目于1987年开始建设，到现在也没有完成和开放。（译者注：看图可见<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/north-koreas-ryugyong-hot_0_n_1918701.html>，可能需要神奇的爬高工具）

Fun fact: the North Korean elites love revolving restaurants. They’re seen as a must-have for any high-end, luxury hotel. The top two hotels in Pyongyang — the [Koryo Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo_Hotel) and the [Yanggakdo Hotel ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanggakdo_International_Hotel)— both have one. So, to ensure its supremacy in the world of hospitality, the Ryugyong Hotel was designed to have not one, not two, but FIVE revolving restaurants! You can see them in the cylindrical cone at the top of the tower in the photos below.

一个有趣的事实是，朝鲜精英很喜欢旋转餐厅。旋转餐厅被视作朝鲜任何一家高端奢华酒店的标配。平壤的两家顶级酒店——[高丽饭店](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo_Hotel)和[羊角岛国际酒店](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanggakdo_International_Hotel)——都各有一处旋转餐厅。故而，柳京饭店为保障自身在全世界好客程度的至高无上性，设计建造了不仅一两座，而是**五座**旋转餐厅！在以下的图片中，从塔顶的圆锥向下可以看见它们。

## Working Life

**工作生活**

During our visit, we had a chance to visit a number of different workplaces, and all of them were just a little bit strange.

我们在旅游期间得以参观朝鲜很多不同的工厂，而所有的工厂看起来都有那么一丝丝奇怪。

- - -

### The Textile Factory

**纺织厂**

One of our first visits was to North Korea’s largest textile factory. All the workers here were women, and it seemed like their lives basically revolved around this factory complex. This work site was like a school campus. It had dorms, convenience stores, and even a small library.

我们一开始访问的一些景点中，就包括朝鲜最大的纺织厂。这里全部的工人都是女性，而且看起来她们的生活基本上是围绕着工厂转的。这座工厂里看起来像是校园。它有宿舍、便利店，甚至还有个小型图书馆。

The convenience store had all your basic living essentials, including some really uncomfortable-looking cardboard toilet paper.

便利店里具备了基本的生活必需品，包括一些看起来让人很不舒服的纸板做的卫生纸。

>Convenience store and library at a textile factory dorm
>
>朝鲜纺织厂里的便利店和图书馆

The dorm rooms were very basic. Women slept 7 to a room, and they were literally packed in like sardines, with their beds stacked side-by-side-by-side. The beaming portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hung overhead.

宿舍房间很简朴。一间房可住7名女工，她们基本上是像沙丁鱼似的给塞进去的。她们的床一个挨着一个排列在一起，头顶上就是发出神圣光辉的金日成和金正日的半身像。

They had prepared a model dorm room for us to see (the same one that Kim Jong Un was shown when he came to tour this factory, we were proudly told). When we were ushered inside, there was a woman fast asleep on one of the beds. This was pretty awkward, but our hosts didn’t seem to think so.

朝鲜人准备了一间“模范寝室”让我们参观。他们还很自豪地告诉我们这间寝室就是金正恩来此视察的时候他们给展示的房间。他们把我们领到寝室里面的时候，有个女的在一张床上睡得很香。这很让人尴尬，但是我们的主家并不这么认为。

Our factory guide also proudly told us that Marshall Kim Jong Un himself personally picked out the paint color for the dorm walls (pink) and the wallpaper (some kind of a peach-taupe concoction).

我们的工厂导游还很自豪地告诉我们，金正恩元帅本人亲自挑选出了宿舍楼墙上的涂色（粉色），以及壁纸（一种像是桃色到褐灰色之间的颜色）。

>Textile factory dorm rooms

>纺织厂里的寝室

The textile factory also had a small museum attached to it, which chronicled not so much the history of fabrics in North Korea, but
rather every visit their Dear Leaders had paid to their workplace. A giant plaque in the main lobby listed the date of every visit. In fact, pretty much every business we went to in North Korea began their tour by talking about how many times their Dear Leaders had graced them with their presence. This was clearly a very big deal for them.

这家纺织厂还有个小型博物馆，它并未记录多少有关朝鲜纺织品的历史，而是记录他们伟大领袖每次访问他们工厂的情况。大厅里有一块大型匾额，记录着每次访问的日期。事实上，我们去参观的几乎每个景点，一开始都是先介绍他们在场的时候，伟大领袖来访问了多少次。这对他们来说可真是重要得可以。

We weren’t allowed to take pictures inside the museum, but one exhibit in particular caught my eye, and I decided that it had to be shared with the world. So, when our tour guide wasn’t looking, I quickly snapped a picture.

博物馆里我们不能拍照，但是展馆里有件东西特别吸引了我的注意，我觉得有必要和全世界分享。所以就在我们的监视人员没注意的时候，我飞快地偷拍了一张。

It was a series of photographs celebrating all the gifts the Dear Leaders have bestowed upon this factory and its workers over the years — tokens of gratitude for all their hard work: oranges, buses, and scarves.

这是一组庆祝朝鲜伟大领导人在过去的时间里赐予这间工厂的组图。伟大的领导人对他们这些年间的工作表示感激（然而并没有什么卵用）：有橘子、buses（这是啥。。公车？）、围巾之类的。

When our tour guide mentioned the scarves, I couldn’t help but question the irony. As politely as I could, I asked our tour guide:

我们的导游提到围巾的时候，我实在忍不住想吐槽一波这里的可笑之处。我尽我最大努力表现得礼貌些，问道：

>**Me**: Did the Dear Leaders gift back to these women the very scarves they themselves had made? “你们的伟大领袖送给这些女工的围巾是不是就是在这个厂生产的？”
>**Tour Guide**: I’m sorry, I don’t understand. “抱歉，我没明白。”
>**Me**: Were these scarves made in this factory? “这些围巾是在这家厂生产的吧？”
>(Long pause) （长时间的沉默）
>**Tour Guide**: I don’t think so. “我不这么觉得。”
>(An even longer, awkward pause) （沉默的时间更长了，长得令人难堪）
>**Tour Guide**: Actually, these scarves were made in a different factory. In Kaesong maybe. Let’s move on. “其实吧，这些围巾是在另外的厂里生产的，可能是在开城吧。我们走。”

I see, thank you. That was very convincing. Yes, let’s move on.

我明白了，谢谢。这十分令人信服。好吧好吧，我们走吧。

### The Electronics Factory

**电子设备厂**

I was really looking forward to this visit. We were supposed to go see an actual working electronics factory called Hana Electronics. According to the [North Korea Tech blog](https://www.northkoreatech.org/tag/hana-electronics/):

我十分向往着这次访问。按原定计划，我们会去参观一处正在实际进行生产的电子厂，叫Hana。据[朝鲜科技博客](https://www.northkoreatech.org/tag/hana-electronics/)所言：

>[Hana Electronics] has been making, or at least assembling, DVD and Video CD players for many years. The actual level of production that goes on at the factory is unknown. The only pictures that have been issued are of what appear to be quality control stations, where finished products are checked.
>
>Hana电子厂多年来一直在制造（或者至少是在组装）DVD和VCD播放器。该厂的实际产出不明。（朝鲜官方）发布的唯一一组图片看起来像是质量控制站，就是完成的产品接受检验的地方。

So much mystery. So much excitement!

好神秘，好兴奋啊！

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*-lO83maKIV2OtnTJVMKgog.jpeg)

>Hana Electronics Factory

>Hana电子厂

Unfortunately, all that excitement went out the window when we showed up, and were brusquely told that there had been a change of plans, and that we would no longer be able to visit the factory. Apparently, the assembly line wasn’t operating that day, and they didn’t want to show us the plant when it was shut down.

不幸的是，我们到了那里之后，就被很突然地告知不能去这个工厂了，我的兴奋劲全飞去爪哇岛了。很明显，组装流水线在那天根本就没有运行，而他们显然不想在工厂关闭的时候让我们去看。

Our group leader argued, but to no avail. I have a strong suspicion that this factory has never actually been operational. As far as I can tell, after doing some research online, no foreigner has ever stepped foot on the factory floor. Either way, we felt completely duped, but there was nothing we could do about it.

我们的领队一直在辩解，但是无济于事。我严重怀疑这家厂根本就没实际开工过。就我从网上所得知的情况看，没有任何一个外国人真正到厂里去过。无论情况为何，我们觉得真心是被耍了，然而却也无法可想。

Instead, the company representatives said that they would be more than happy to show us their music library. I don’t think we had much choice in the matter. Regardless, what we were shown was just plain strange.

相反，厂里的负责人说他们十分愿意带领我们去他们的音乐展览馆。我看这情况我们也没啥选的了。无论怎样，我们看见的东西都奇怪得可以。

We were led onto a barren office floor filled with 100 cubicles. Each cubicle had a computer, and every computer was off, except for one that they had turned on expressly for us. We were the only people in the entire space.

他们把我们带到了一间办公室里，里面有100个隔间，但是一个人都没有。每个隔间里都有一台电脑，而除了其中的一台是特意给我们打开的之外，其余的全部关闭。整个偌大的空间只有我们这几个人。

On that computer, they pulled up a collection of music videos, all hand-chosen by Marshall Kim Jong Un himself. We then spent 15 minutes watching propaganda music videos on a small computer monitor. I was getting horrible flashbacks from our Air Koryo flight into Pyongyang.

在这台电脑上，他们翻出了一组MV，全部是他们金正恩元帅亲自挑选的。接下来的15分钟内，我们就一直在这个小小的电脑屏上看着这些MV宣传片，这勾起了我对于来时高丽航空班机上的惨烈回忆。

>A completely empty computer room at the Hana Electronics factory
>
>Hana电子厂里空无一人的电脑室

When the videos stopped, I thought we could finally escape, but the situation only got worse. Our guide excitedly led us into another room, which turned out to be a small theater. She instructed us to sit down.

这些视频放完之后，我觉得我们终于可以完全逃离这个地方了，但是情形正在变得更糟。我们的导游十分兴奋地把我们带到了另一间房里，这个房是个小剧场，她让我们坐下来。

She proceeded to explain that Marshall Kim Jong Un himself designed the acoustics for this room, and personally tested different audio systems: 5.1, 7.1, and 9.1 channel setups. He ultimately settled on 5.1. Great choice Dear Marshall!

她还接着解释，金正恩元帅亲自为房间设计了音响系统，他挨个测试了不同的音响：5.1、7.1以及9.1声道设置。他最终选择了5.1。大元帅这个选择有点牛逼！

We were then subjected to another 20 minutes of music videos, but this time in all the wondrousness of Dolby surround sound. I tried to walk out halfway through, but was told to sit back down.

接下来我们不得不又看了20分钟的MV，但这次全部是神奇的杜比环绕声。我想在半途走掉，但是导游他们要求我们坐下。

<blockquote name="091f" id="091f" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">Apparently, Marshall Kim Jong Un really likes Sarah Brightman
很明显，金正恩元帅是真心喜欢莎拉·布莱曼。</blockquote>

The last video we had to watch was Sarah and Andrea Bocelli singing [Time to Say Goodbye](https://youtu.be/LWQbuJ24Wzg). I used to love that song. But now, and forever more, hearing that song will conjure memories of being trapped in this theater, and the scintillating soprano of Sarah’s voice will forever haunt me.

我们被迫看的最后一个视频是莎拉·布莱曼和安德烈·波切利唱的[是时候说再见](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjI4MzY4NTE2.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2)。我之前很喜欢这首歌，但是从现在开始，从今以后，听见这首就会勾起我在朝鲜被困在这个剧院的惨烈回忆，而莎拉那才华横溢的女高音将会长期在我的脑海里阴魂不散。。

In the end, the closest we ever got to Hana Electronics’ alleged products was in its company store, which, conveniently, also sold teddy bears, bathing suits, and women’s face cream.

最终，我们与Hana电子厂所谓的“产品”最近距离的接触是在它的自营商店里，而这家店还很贴心地卖泰迪熊、浴衣还有女用的护肤霜。

###The Car Dealership

**汽车经销店**

Another absolutely bizarre business we visited was an auto dealership in Pyongyang called [Pyeonghwa Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeonghwa_Motors). Here, they allegedly sold North Korean-made cars. I say “allegedly,” because I had serious doubts about how real this whole operation was.

另一个通体奇怪的东西是平壤举行的一次汽车经销会，叫做[平和自动车](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeonghwa_Motors)。在这里他们声称他们是在卖朝鲜生产的汽车。我说“声称”是因为我严重怀疑整个买卖真实性到底有多少。

In fact, the entire showroom felt staged, complete with fake customers conducting fake business, and having fake conversations with fake salespeople.

实际上整个展厅给人一种在演戏的感觉，顾客是假的，谈的生意也是假的，与假的销售人员的对话也是假的。

But don’t take my word for it. Check out this video I shot, and judge for yourself:

但是别我说啥你都信。你看看我拍的视频，自己决断：

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7VwnijyVig?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

###The Farming Cooperative

**农业合作社**

We spent a couple days driving around the countryside, and it was clear that life out here was not as easy as in the city.

我们有几天的行程是坐车走在乡下。很明显乡下的生活比城里的还要艰苦。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*FeUljKxwo8LXYPWi2jpe_w.jpeg) ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lRIsNLPLUY5NqaxLHl7a8w.jpeg)

>The North Korean countryside
>
>朝鲜的乡下景观

We were taken to a cooperative farming operation on the outskirts of [Kaesong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong), the ancient capital city of Koryo (basically a unified Korea, before the land was split into North and South).

我们被带到了[开城](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong)市郊的一处农业合作社。开城是之前高丽国（基本上就是朝鲜半岛给分裂成南北韩之前的统一的朝鲜半岛）的首都。

The local guide was reasonably cordial, but he didn’t seem to know what to do with us. We took a quick walk through the fields, which was very uneventful. And then he showed us where the workers lived. I was surprised they let us see this place.

当地的导游颇为友好，但是他看起来不知道应该和我们做些什么。我们在田间很快地走了一圈，甚是无聊。然后他带我们去看了工人工作的地方，竟然能让我们看这样的地方，我真心感到惊奇。

The homes were completely run-down and dilapidated. Most of the windows were barred, apparently to prevent break-ins — something the government would never admit was happening. The entrances to the homes pointed straight into their outhouses. I felt bad for anyone who would have to live here.

房子完全是破败不堪，年久失修。很多窗口都是堵死的，很明显这是为了防止有人突然闯入——这是政府从来不会承认发生的事情。从房门入口可以一眼看见房子外面。我真是替那些不得不住在这的人感到心塞。

And that’s when you can’t help but wonder:

然后，你就会忍不住想：

<blockquote name="c90e" id="c90e" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--pullquote-quote is-other" name="anon_d989a5a20d93" data-creator-ids="anon">They would only be showing us this place if this is the best they’ve got. So, if this is the best, what does the worst look like?
他们只会给我们展示他们最能拿得上台面的东西。那如果这是他们的最好水平，那最差的得是啥样的啊？</span></blockquote>

### The Dear Leaders

**伟大领袖**

Throughout this post, I’ve made a lot of references to The Dear Leaders. Who exactly are these men? Let me break it down for you:

全篇博文我都大量地提到了朝鲜的伟大领袖们。他们到底是什么人啊？看我给你们科普一下啊：

1. [President Kim Il Sung ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung)— The granddaddy of The Dear Leaders. Literally. Kim Il Sung was the founding Supreme Leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and is referred to as the nation’s “Eternal President.”  [朝鲜领导人金日成](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung)——他是这些伟大领袖们的祖宗。字面上看，他是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的开国领袖，至高无上。他被称作朝鲜“永恒的主席”。

2. [General Kim Jong Il](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il)— Son of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il served as the DPRK’s Supreme Leader until he passed in 2011.  [朝鲜将军金正日](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il)——金日成的儿子。金正日一直当着朝鲜的最高领导人，直到他2011年逝世。

3. [Marshall Kim Jong Un ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un)— Son of Kim Jong Il, the 32-year old is the current Supreme Leader of the DPRK. Fun story: Kim Jong Un’s exact birthday was always shrouded in mystery until Dennis Rodman accidentally revealed the state secret after returning from a visit to North Korea in 2013.    [金正恩元帅](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un)——金正日的儿子。现年32岁的他是朝鲜现在的最高领导人。有意思的是，金正恩真正的生日一直是个谜团，直到丹尼斯·罗德曼2013年在一次访朝回国之后一不小心揭开了这个国家机密。

Amongst the North Koreans we were exposed to, the Dear Leaders are revered like Gods. Everywhere you turn, there are statues, paintings, mosaics, songs, and books dedicated to the greatness of these men.

在我们所见到的朝鲜人中，这些伟大领袖受到无比的崇敬，就像上帝一样，你在什么地方都能看见各种雕像、绘画、浮雕、歌曲、书籍，专门描绘这些人的伟大之处。

On any given day, you’ll find North Koreans making pilgrimages to giant statues of their Dear Leaders, and paying their respects by bowing deeply and laying flowers at their feet.

在任何特定的日子里，你就会看见朝鲜人去参拜他们伟大领袖的巨大雕像，他们在塑像前深鞠躬并把花束放在脚下，表达他们对领袖的尊敬。

I secretly shot this picture at the entrance to the Pyongyang Water Park. They literally have Kim Jong Il chillin’ on a beach scene straight out of a Katy Perry music video. Photos were strictly prohibited, and they had a guard standing there whose only job was to make sure you didn’t take photos of this statue. I had to get really clever in order to grab this photo.

在平壤戏水乐园的入口前，我偷偷地拍了一张这个图。他们直接让金正日这个在海滩上晒太阳的场景出现在Katy Perry的一个MV里。我们被严格禁止拍照，他们甚至专门搞了个守卫在那里，其职责就是专门保证你不拍这座雕像。为了拍到这张图我可是费了很大劲。

## The Schools

**朝鲜的学校**

During our trip, we toured two schools: 1) a primary school in Pyongsong, a small, provincial city north of Pyongyang, and 2) the Children’s Palace, a school in the capital city for gifted children.

在我们的旅行当中，我们访问了两所学校。一个是平城的一所小学——平城是平壤北部的一个小的特别市——另一所是在平壤的少年宫，专为天赋奇佳的孩子们准备。

<blockquote name="c124" id="c124" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">Both of these school visits were simultaneously touching and disturbing
对这两所学校的访问都很让人印象深刻，但是也看得让人不安</blockquote>

On one hand, the kids were truly adorable, and some of them were really impressively talented.

一方面，这里的孩子们真心都很讨人喜欢，他们当中的一些人才华横溢，令人印象深刻。

There was a young boy who started off by singing a cappella into a Madonna-esque headset. After a couple minutes, he suddenly jumped behind a drum kit, and started accompanying himself on the drums:

有个小男孩一上台先是戴个耳机清唱，几分钟之后，他就突然跳到了一套鼓的旁边，开始敲起来：

Then there were the 7-year old ping pong masters who crushed all of us in table tennis:

然后还有那些七岁小男孩，乒乓球打得特好，我们谁都不是他们的对手：

Across both visits, countless children who were paraded out to showcase their artistic and musical talents:

在这两场访问的间隙，数不清的孩子们涌了出来，向我们展示他们的艺术和音乐才能：

>Talented young students at the Children’s Palace in Pyongyang
>
>平壤青少年宫，很有才的孩子们

What was so disturbing about these school visits was how meticulously choreographed and over-rehearsed the whole experience was.

让人觉得浑身不自在的则是这些学校的访问都是多么小心翼翼地设计编排，排练了一遍又一遍的。

<blockquote name="afc7" id="afc7" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">These schools seemed to be just one giant theatrical production, and the child actors had no say in the matter
这些学校看起来就像是一个个巨大的剧场，而孩子们在这一切中并没有发言权</blockquote>

Perhaps some of these kids genuinely enjoyed putting on these performances. A number of them legitimately looked like they were having fun. Many others, though, had anxious, plastic smiles plastered on their faces. Either way, one thing was for sure: we were witnessing first-hand a massive propaganda machine in action.

也许，这其中的一些孩子是真心喜欢进行这种表演的。他们当中的很多人很合理地表现得像是他们很快乐。而还有很多其他的孩子们，他们脸上的笑容看起来很焦虑，很生硬地刷在他们的脸上。不管怎样，有一点确信无疑：我们亲眼所见到的，是一个正轰轰运转的巨型的宣传机器。

The music the students played on their accordions and [gayageum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayageum), a traditional Korean stringed instrument, was the same tune repeated over and over again, for a seemingly endless revolving door of foreign visitors. Look at the faces of these girls after they finish playing their instruments. Maybe it’s just me, but I think the look of fatigue is written all over their faces.

学生们拿手风琴和[伽倻琴](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayageum)——这是朝鲜的一种传统弦乐乐器——表演的就是同一段旋律，来回地重复。看起来就像是我们外国人用的那种旋转门一样。你们可以看看那些女生弹完他们乐器时候的那个样子——我想，她们的脸上应该是写满了疲倦——但也许这只是我的个人观点罢了。

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AyFcSpQMYc?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>Gayageum performance at the Children’s Palace in Pyongyang
>
>平壤青少年宫的伽倻琴表演

Down the hall, in an English class, we watch as a group of children repeat the same 4 lines of text over and over again. I’m not sure they knew any other English.

在走廊另一头，正在上着英语课。我们就看见一群小孩把同样的4行文字重复了一遍又一遍。我不太确定他们是不是就光会这么几句英语了。

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suO4Ih84TZs?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>English class in North Korea
>
>朝鲜的英语课

Even the performances themselves, while impressive displays of talent, just felt a bit odd. Like here, in this accordion performance, the musicians’ movements just felt so… robotic.

甚至这些节目本身，虽然展示出了朝鲜孩子们的技能，但是就是看起来怪怪的。比如在这里这个手风琴表演中，这些音乐家的动作就让人觉得……好生硬啊。

## Technology

**科技**

### Smartphones

**智能机**

I was surprised by how many smartphones I saw in North Korea. My minder was kind enough to let us browse around her device.

在朝鲜，我看见了好多的智能机，这委实让人意想不到。我们的监视员人很好，让我们看了看她的设备。

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfk0mPADJXY?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>Checking out a North Korean-branded smartphone
>
>我们查看朝鲜品牌的智能机

It was a North Korean-branded device, called the Arirang, running a modification of Android Jellybean.

这是一个朝鲜品牌的手机，叫做阿里郎，运行的是修改版的Android Jellybean（4.2.1）。

And believe it or not, the phone had apps! The first app our minder showed us was a Juche pocket reference guide, so you could look up Kim Il Sung’s teachings while on the go.

而且就说你信不信吧，这手机竟然有应用程序！我们的监视员首先给我们看的是一个移动版的主体思想参考手册，这样你就可以走在路上也能查看金日成的教诲了。

We then checked out a mosquito repellent app, which emitted an annoying, piercingly-high pitched tone. However, I’ll tell you what, if it really works, that’s the first app I’m going to download when I get back home.

我们接下来又看了一个防蚊软件，这软件会发出一种吵人刺耳的声音。但是我会告诉你，这软件若是真的有用，那我回国后第一个下载的就是它了。

My most favorite app, though, was what looked like the [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) app. I got all excited when I saw it.

我最喜欢的应用，就是这个看起来像[谷歌云端硬盘](https://www.google.com/drive/)的这个。我看见这个软件的时候整个人都提起劲来了。

<blockquote name="c423" id="c423" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">Google? In North Korea?? How can this be??
谷歌？在朝鲜？？这怎么可能？……</blockquote>

I tapped on the icon, and let out a sigh of disappointment. What popped up on the screen was some Korean desktop themes app. Apparently, US trademark laws haven’t made their way into North Korea yet.

我点了一下这个图标，然后发出了一声失望的叹息。展现在我们眼前的是一个朝鲜桌面主题应用。很明显美国商标法对于朝鲜这里还是鞭长莫及啊。

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1000/1*dA8Id57Dk94rAvZKY-8U9w.jpeg) ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4z25rW9BrXhwz--D9-qi3w.png)

>Google Drive app in North Korea!! (almost)
>
>我在朝鲜发现了谷歌硬盘应用啊啊！！（好吧 差点是）

Encouraged by the sight of all these apps, though, I wanted to see what other kinds of apps my minder could download onto her phone.

但是看见了这些各种应用之后，我还想知道的是我的监视员还能下什么其它的软件在上面。

>**Me:** So you have an App Store? 那你们有应用商店？
>**Minder:** Yes. 是啊。
>**Me:** Awesome! Can I see it? 哇好棒！让我看看好不？
>**Minder:** No. 不行。

Oops! At this point, I was afraid I had crossed one of the many invisible lines in North Korea, and accidentally stepped into an Off Limits Zone.

我擦……这会我觉得我怕是已然跨过了朝鲜众多隐形底线之一，一不小心进入了一个禁区。

>**Me:** Oh, I’m sorry. Am I not allowed to see it? 哦抱歉……我真的不能看看么？
>**Minder:** No, it’s not that. It’s just not here. 不行，不是这个。它不在这地方。
>**Me:** Not here? I don’t understand. Where is it? 不在这里……？我不明白，那在哪啊？
>**Minder:** Well, it’s a store. We would have to go there. 呃，这是个商店，我们得去那里才行。
>**Me:** Wait, your App Store is a physical store?? (pause, as I digest this incredible information) Can we visit one? 等一下，你们的应用商店是实体店？？（这里停顿了下，我刚好正消化这神奇的信息）我们能去看看吗？
>**Minder:** No, it’s not on our itinerary. 不行，这不在我们的行程内。

I couldn’t believe my ears. Their App Store was an actual place! You physically go to this place, ask a man behind the counter for the Mosquito Repellent app, pay him, and he plugs a cable into your phone and installs it for you! Mind officially blown.

我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。他们的应用商店竟然是实体的！你得亲自“去”这个地方，给柜台后面的人说，想要那个防蚊软件，然后给他交钱，他会给你手机插上个线，给你把软件装上！三观真心刷新了啊。

While in North Korea, I also tried really hard to buy a local smartphone to bring back to the US. However, I apparently wasn’t allowed to, although no one would give me a straight answer about this. Instead, what I could have purchased was a North Korean SIM card for over $200 USD. This would have given me phone service within North Korea, and even spotty 3G data from time-to-time (at over $1 USD per megabyte). But even then, I’d be behind the North Korean firewall. So, good luck trying to access Gmail or Facebook.

在朝鲜，我也很努力想要搞一个他们当地的手机带回美国。但是，很明显我并不准去购买这样一台手机，即使没人给我明说。而我当时应该可以买到的是朝鲜的SIM卡，大概200多美元。这样我就能在朝鲜打电话，甚至有时候能收到断断续续的3G信号（流量大概1美元多一兆）。但是尽管如此，我还是身处朝鲜防火墙背后。如果你想访问Gmail或者Facebook的话，那么祝你好运:)

### Internet vs Intranet

**互联网 局域网**

As expected, there was no Internet.

和我想得一样，朝鲜是没有互联网的。

However, there did appear to be a national Intranet. It didn’t seem like most citizens had access to this either, but a couple institutions we went to did seem to be wired in.

但是，看起来朝鲜的确有国家级的局域网，但好像尽管如此，大多数的民众也不能访问。但是我们访问的一些组织机关看上去的确是连着局域网的。

One of these institutions was the primary school in Pyongsong. The first thing the headmistress showed us when we arrived was the school’s webpage. Yup, you heard me correctly. A webpage — complete with animated gifs and cheesy MIDI background music.

这些机关其中之一就是平城的那所小学。我们一到，校长给我们看的第一件东西就是他们学校的网页。不错，你听的没错。一个网页——完整的网页，上面有GIF动画图以及山寨感很强的midi音乐。

The website looked like something you would have found on [Yahoo! GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) back in 2000. Here’s some video I took as some of the school administrators were demo’ing the webpage to us. Make sure you watch all the way to the end for the crazy surprise…

这个网页看起来很像是2000年的[Yahoo! GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities)。在学校的管理人员给我们演示网页的时候，我拍了一些视频。你一定得从头看到尾，最后可有大惊喜……

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ewpdrPUap8?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>Demo of a primary school’s webpage in Pyongsong, North Korea
>
>平城小学的网站演示

Didn’t make it all the way to the end of the video? Okay, I’ll tell you what happened. Towards the end of the demo, the administrator nonchalantly clicks on another app on the computer, and suddenly a grid of video thumbnails fills the screen.

你没有看完哪？好吧我告诉你发生了什么。演示快结束的时候，管理员若无其事地打开了电脑上的另一个软件，突然屏幕上就出现了一个网格，里面全是视频的缩略图。

Everyone’s jaw dropped when we saw this. We were staring at live video feeds of every classroom in the school. Crazy!

看见这个的时候，我们每个人下巴都惊讶得合不拢，我们看的是学校里所有教室的实时视频监控。太疯狂了！

我又把监控的画面拍了一些视频：

During our tour of the primary school, the administrators made sure they showed us their computer room, which was comprised mostly of old Dell Latitude towers. The room was very empty.

在我们访问这所小学的时候，这些管理人员还要确定他们给我们展示过了电脑室。电脑室里基本上就是老式的戴尔Latitude台式机。整个房间很空。

### The Three Revolution Museum

**三大革命博物馆**

Another destination our minders insisted on including in our itinerary was a visit to the [Three Revolution Museum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Revolution_Exhibition)— a sprawling complex comprised of 5 or 6 massive exhibition halls. This is where North Korea celebrates the nation’s revolutionary advances in ideology, technology, and culture.

我们的监视员坚持让我们去的另外一个地方，就是[三大革命博物馆](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Revolution_Exhibition)——这是一处杂乱无序的混合体，由五六个大型展厅组成。这里是朝鲜庆祝全国意识形态、科学技术以及文化（这三个）革命性突破的地方。

The best way to describe this place?

如何贴切地描述这个地方那？

<blockquote name="ff5c" id="ff5c" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p is-withNotes">Imagine the Smithsonian Institute mashed up with Disney’s Epcot Center, but then stripped clean of any fun and truth
想象一下[史密森尼博物院](http://www.si.edu/)和迪士尼的[未来世界中心](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/epcot/)混合在一起，然后剥夺了全部乐趣和真相的那个样子</blockquote>

Inside, we walked past exhibit after exhibit that shocked and awed. There was an enormous replica of a CNC machine, a towering rocket, and even a miniature model of the country’s nuclear reactors (yikes!).

在里面，我们走过一件件令人震惊和肃然起敬的展品。展厅里有一个硕大无比的CNC机器的复制品，一个安装在发射塔上的火箭，甚至还有一个朝鲜核反应堆的缩小模型（我擦……）

>Exhibits inside the Three Revolution Museum
>
>三大革命博物馆里的展品

And the grand finale in this hodge-podge collection of technological bric-a-brac? Around the corner from the nuclear reactor, we found ourselves staring at a display of old school, corded telephones. Yup.

那这堆科技老古董大杂烩最后的压轴大戏是啥呢？从核反应堆模型过去之后，接下来我们发现正对着我们展示的是那种学校里用的老式的有、线、电、话。嗯，没错。

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*DR3nopbOGFOKkQeUIhUtQQ.jpeg)

>A display of landline phones at The Three Revolutions Museum
>
>三大革命博物馆展出的固网电话

And just to further add to the surrealism of this trip, we were the only people in the entire museum. When we arrived, all the power in the building had been switched off (I assume to conserve electricity). So, as we wandered the museum halls, a woman would walk in front of us, and flip on power switches for each exhibit one by one. We certainly felt very VIP.

而且，更让我们觉得整个旅程离奇怪诞的，则是我们就是整个博物馆里仅有的访客。我们刚到的时候，整幢楼里的灯全部是熄灭的（我想这是为了省电）。所以当我们在博物馆里游走的时候，有个女士会走在我们前面，挨个打开展品上的灯。我们真心觉得受到的不是一般的礼遇啊。

To get an even better sense of this place, check out this video tour I shot from inside the museum:

想要更好了解这个博物馆的话，可以看看我在博物馆里拍的这段视频：

### The DMZ

**非军事区**

For a country that is officially at war with its sister nation just to the south, the threat of conflict is very real in North Korea. And nowhere is this risk of war more palpable than at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.

作为一个官方宣称与就在它南边的姊妹国“处于战争状态”的国家，在朝鲜，爆发冲突的威胁甚是现实。而在朝韩之间的非军事区，这种战争的风险再明显不过了。

The drive from Pyongyang to Panmunjom, the border city at the DMZ, is 3 hours long — placing Pyongyang twice as far from a potential border battle, compared to Seoul, which is less than a 90 minute drive away.

从平壤到板门店这个非军事区边境上的城市，车程足足三个小时——这使得平壤离可能的边境作战的距离是首尔的两倍远——首尔离非军事区乘车不到一个半小时。

The drive down to Panmunjom was really interesting. The highway was 6 lanes wide, and yet the road was almost completely devoid of cars for the entire 3 hour drive. We mostly just saw people biking and walking along the edge of the asphalt. The only other vehicles we saw were military jeeps and an occasional bus or two.

去板门店的路程颇有些意思。高速公路是6车道宽的，但是在我们三个小时的车程中，这条路基本上就是空的。多数情形下我们仅仅看见有人在柏油路边上骑自行车或者走路。我们能看见的其他车就只有军用吉普，偶尔会看见一两辆大巴车。

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*nhC21TMYfbxcTj--wOulaQ.jpeg)

>A six lane-wide highway with not a car in sight
>
>六车道的高速公路，一辆车都看不见

As we got closer to the DMZ, the military checkpoints got more and more frequent, and the soldiers at these checkpoints looked more and more fierce. Each time we approached one, our minders would emphatically remind us not to take any pictures.

随着我们离非军事区越来越近，军事检查站越来越频繁了，而且检查站里的士兵也是一个比一个凶。我们每接近一处检查站，我们的监视员都会特别强调着提醒我们，不要拍任何照片。

One fascinating thing: every mile or two, the North Korean army had erected giant concrete towers by the side of the road. Some of these were thinly disguised as monuments. But these towers served a much more significant purpose. Should the South Koreans ever break across the border and march north, the North Koreans would blow up the base of these towers, causing them to topple over onto the road and block the advance of South Korean tanks.

有件吸引人的事是，每经过一两哩，就会看见朝鲜军队在路边建造的巨型混凝土高塔。其中有些是伪装成了纪念碑。但是这些高塔还有一个更为重要的目的，就是如果韩国人胆敢突破国境线向北进军的话，朝鲜人就会炸毁这些塔的地基，使得这些塔整体倒下横在路中间，阻挡前进的韩国坦克。

When we arrived at the DMZ, the air was electric. The name Demilitarized Zone is really a misnomer. This was one of the most militarized places I’ve ever seen. Security was super tight. We were escorted by soldiers single-file around the compound.

我们到达非军事区的时候，觉得空气都会放出电来。“非军事区”这个名字真是起得不妥，这里是我所见过的军事化程度最高的地方之一。安全检查特别特别严格。我们被士兵押成一路纵队四处走着。

###The Bombing Run

**“轰炸航程”**

During our drive back from the DMZ to Pyongyang, we were passing through some farmland when we saw a small biplane approach from the west. I rushed to the window of our shuttle and managed to grab a couple pictures of the plane as it flew right over us.

在我们从非军事区开回平壤的路上，穿过一些农田的时候，我们看见一个小的双翼飞机从西边飞来。我冲到车窗前面，成功地在它飞越我们头顶的时候抓拍到了几张飞机的图片。

>双翼军用飞机飞过我们头顶

As the plane pulled away from us, I stopped taking photos, but continued to watch the plane. Suddenly, I saw a black object drop from the bottom of the aircraft. My first immediate thought was that the plane was dropping an aid package to the farming village below. Seriously. My second thought was that this was some kind of a mail drop.

飞机飞过之后，我就没再拍照，但是还是观察着飞机。突然，我看见有个黑黑的东西从飞机底部掉了下来。我的第一感觉就是飞机在给下面的村庄投放援助包裹。我说的真话。我的第二感觉就是这应该是某种邮件投递服务。

Both of those theories went out the window when the black object lit up midair, and rocketed straight into the earth below, leaving behind a fiery contrail. Before I could realize what was happening, a second rocket shot out from the bottom of the plane, again straight into the ground below.

我的这两种想法很快飞出了窗外，因为这个黑黑的东西在半空中发出了耀眼的光，并且直直地扎入了地下，留下火亮的尾迹（contrail是飞机或导弹在飞行时留下的凝结尾流——译者注）。我还没来得及反应发生了什么事情，小飞机又投出了一枚火箭，同样直直地打入地下。

Both rockets then exploded, launching a towering column of fire and smoke into the air.

两枚火箭随后爆炸，火光和浓烟直冲天际。

<blockquote name="0ce8" id="0ce8" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">We had just witnessed a bombing run!
我们刚看见的是“轰炸航程”啊！</blockquote>

The military was literally shooting missiles out of a biplane, less than one mile away from us! And by the looks of it, the locals were just as surprised as we were. You can see them all standing in the foreground of the picture below, staring at the smoky aftermath of the explosion.

朝鲜军队竟然从双翼飞机里往外投弹，离我们还不到一哩！从面部表情上看，当地人就和我们一样惊讶，你看下面这张图片，他们站在前面，盯着投弹爆炸之后冒着烟的这一切。

>The aftermath of two rocket explosions, less than one mile away from us
>
>两次导弹爆炸之后的场景，一切离我们不到一哩

Our entire group was in shock. I turned to our minders, to see if they had anything to say about what just happened. They didn’t. They just stared straight ahead at the road as if nothing had happened.

我们整个团的游客都吓坏坏了。我转头看我们的监视员，看看他们对刚发生的一切作何评论。他们什么都没说，只是直直地盯着前面的路，就像什么都没发生一样。

### The Korean War Museum

**朝鲜战争博物馆**

Another war-related visit on our trip was to the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, or, as most people simply call it: the Korean War Museum.

我们整个行程中与战争有关的另外一项活动是去“祖国解放战争胜利纪念馆”，或者说就像大多数人说的那样：朝鲜战争博物馆。

This museum was more like a palace, complete with an enormous crystal chandelier, a marble staircase straight out of the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, and a two story tall statue of King Il Sung greeting you as you walked into the lobby. I wish I could have taken photo of it for you, but cameras were strictly prohibited inside.

这座博物馆更像是一座宫殿，它有一个巨型的水晶吊灯，台阶是大理石做的，和拉斯维加斯的[威尼斯大酒店](http://www.venetian.com/)一样一样的。还有一个两层楼高的金日成雕像在你走进博物馆的时候向你问好。我本想拍一张这个博物馆的图片，但是博物馆里是严禁拍照的。

Our military guide was a rather intimidating, humorless soldier who spent most of her time elaborating on the evil and moral decrepitude of the American Imperialists. I really wanted to know how she rationalized the fact that she was delivering this speech to a group of, well, Americans.

我们的军队导游是个相当吓人还缺乏幽默感的军人，大多数时间她都是在详尽地描述美帝国主义的邪恶和腐朽。我实在是想知道她如何能理性地解释这样一个事实，即她正对着一群，呃……美国人进行这样的演讲。

>朝鲜祖国胜利解放战争纪念馆一游

The biggest trophy at this museum was the USS Pueblo, a US Navy ship that was attacked and captured in 1968. Our guide took us aboard, and pointed out, in painstaking detail, all the shrapnel holes the gallant North Korean sailors had shot into the hull of the ship. The pride was oozing from her voice.

而这家博物馆里最大的战利品则是普韦布洛号，一艘美国海军的舰艇，于1968年（在执行任务时）被朝鲜攻击并截获。我们的导游将我们带上船，以细化得让人痛苦的方式指出了英勇的朝鲜海军士兵用弹片打进这艘船的每一个孔。她的声音里满是自豪。

>朝鲜战争纪念馆 普韦布洛号一游

All of these tanks, planes, and ships on display outside, however, paled in comparison to what we were about to see inside the museum palace itself. We were whisked through room after room of lies and horrors. Perhaps the most over-the-top exhibit was a life-sized diorama depicting a macabre war scene where maimed American soldiers lay dead or dying on a scorched battlefield. A black crow stood atop the body of a dead soldier in the center of the tableau, picking away at his heart.

室外展出的所有这些坦克飞机舰船之类的，与我们在博物馆内所见相比简直是相形见绌。我们在一间间充满谎言与恐惧的展室里快速地移动。可能最过分的展品就是有个真人比例的立体模型，描绘的是受重伤的美国士兵躺在烧焦的战场上一动不动。一只乌鸦站在一个士兵的尸体上啄食他的心脏——这个模型就放在正中间。

We were all relieved to finally leave that place.

最后离开那里的时候，我们都感到无比的轻松。

### The Military Parade

**阅兵式**

During our visit, the country was preparing for a massive celebration: the 70th anniversary of its communist party. The festivities would take place on October 10, 2015, their Party Foundation Day, and would include the biggest military parade demonstration the country had ever staged.

我们去的时候，朝鲜正为它的全民庆典——朝鲜劳动党执政70周年纪念日做准备。这次盛大活动将会在今年10月10日举行。本次阅兵式将是朝鲜举行的军事阅兵当中，规模最大的一次。

Thousands and thousands of volunteers had been granted weeks of leave from work to rehearse for the enormous spectacle. Throughout the week, day and night, we saw masses of people lined up in formation, practicing their marching routines over and over again.

国家给成千上万的志愿者放了长达数周的假，让他们排练准备这次的盛大活动。整整一周，从早到晚，我们都能看见一群群的人排成方阵，一遍又一遍地排练他们的整个阅兵的流程。

The sheer scale of it all was both impressive and intimidating. And this was before they had even rolled out the tanks and antiballistic missiles!

整个阅兵式不仅很让人印象深刻，还特别具有威慑力。此外这次还是他们首次展出他们的坦克和反弹道导弹！

## Best Moments

**最美时刻**

Out of my entire week in North Korea, three moments in particular stood out as highlights. In all three cases, I found myself interacting with real locals in a way I never thought I would, and it was this human connection that made these experiences so special.

在我在朝鲜的整整一周，有三个时刻特别令人难忘。在这三件事中，我都是在与真正的朝鲜当地人交流，我从未想到我会以这种方式和他们这样互动，而也正是这人与人之间的交流，才使得这些经历如此特别。

- - -

### Singing in the Park

**在公园唱歌**

The first highlight took place one afternoon, as we were hiking in Moran Hill Park in Pyongyang. The park is located in the middle of the city, and is actually quite large in size — perhaps a quarter the size of New York’s Central Park? Much of the park is forested, and pretty hilly. Scattered throughout the park are grassy clearings where locals would gather and picnic.

第一个是在某日下午，我们当时正在平壤的莫兰山公园徒步旅游——这个公园位于平壤市中心，而且看起来的确很大，大概是纽约中央公园的四分之一大吧。公园的大部分有植被覆盖，地势崎岖不平。公园里散布着些由草覆盖的土地，当地人会在那里搞聚会、野餐啥的。

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*caK8Bj9TsjB2CxFyX5u8EA.jpeg)

>North Koreans relaxing on a Sunday in Moran Hill Park
>
>周日，朝鲜人在莫兰山公园休息

We visited on a Sunday, which was a day off for many North Koreans. As a result, there were lots of locals spread out throughout the park. At first, I was feeling a bit disappointed that we were wasting an afternoon trudging around a public park.

我们去那里的时候正逢周日，是很多朝鲜人休息的日子。于是，公园里有好多朝鲜当地人。一开始的时候我有点点失望——我们浪费了一整个下午就在个公园里转悠，累得如狗一般。

We tried smiling or saying hi to locals as we walked past, and most just ignored us. Some of the younger kids would giggle amongst themselves and then run off.

我们走过那些朝鲜人的时候，试着对他们微笑或者问好，但是他们大多数完全无视我们。有些年幼点的孩子会互相偷偷地笑，然后快速跑开。

15 minutes into the hike, I saw group of North Koreans gathered in a clearing about 100 feet away. They weren’t very close to the path we were on, but their singing caught my attention. The men (who seemed just a bit drunk) had stripped off their soldier uniforms, and were dancing in their tank tops.

步行15分钟之后，我就看见一群朝鲜人聚在一片大概离我们100英尺之外的一片空地上。他们离我们要走的路并不是很靠近，但是他们的歌声吸引了我的注意。这些人（看起来有些微醺）脱掉了他们的士兵服，穿着坎肩在跳舞。

Amused, I danced back at them from the path. The saw me, and instead of ignoring me, they laughed and danced right back at me.

我就觉得有点意思，就沿着路跳着舞回应他们。他们看见了我，并且也回应我跳着舞，而不是对我视而不见。

<blockquote name="b626" id="b626" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">Ladies and gentlemen: we have a North Korean dance off!
女士们先生们，这里是朝鲜舞会的现场！</blockquote>

After a couple minutes of this, they waved at me to come join them. This was awesome! I looked over at our minder, and she gave a nod. Woohoo!

这样跳了几分钟后，他们向我挥手让我加入他们。好棒啊！我看了一眼我们的监视员，她点了一下头。哦吼！

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*oiYq61lF_i_Rns8PYsppFg.jpeg)

>Our newfound North Korean friends
>
>我们新交的朝鲜朋友们

Our group scrambled down a small hill, dodged through some trees, and joined the North Koreans in the clearing. For the next 15 minutes, we sang and danced with our new friends. Some of the locals seemed a bit uncomfortable with our presence, and stepped back. However, the men were really into it. We sang some Korean songs, including a famous folk song called Arirang. Well, the Koreans sang, and we did our best to fake it.

我们这一行人爬下了一个小山丘，穿过了些树木，加入了空地上的朝鲜人。接下来的15分钟内，我们与我们的新朋友们载歌载舞。有些当地人对于我们的出现觉得有点不适，于是退了后。但是这些朝鲜人的确非常投入。我们唱了几首朝鲜歌曲，包括一首很出名的民歌，叫《阿里郎》。呃好吧，朝鲜人唱着，我们则尽最大努力去模仿。

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVBPoNuem8Y?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>More singing and dancing with our newfound North Korean friends
>
>与我们新交的朝鲜朋友各种载歌载舞

Then, the Koreans motioned for us to sing something. I quickly wracked my brain and started singing the first inoffensive song that came to my head: “Be Our Guest” from Disney’s Beauty and the Beast. Yup, what better way to bridge two warring nations, than a little Disney.

然后，那些朝鲜人鼓励我们也唱些啥。我迅速地在我的脑海中搜索，然后唱了我想到的头一首没有侵犯性的歌——迪斯尼《美女与野兽》中的《Be Our Guest》。不错，要沟通这两个处于敌对中的国家，小小的迪士尼再合适不过。

Without understanding a single word that I was saying, the Koreans happily danced to the music:

那些朝鲜人一点都不懂我唱的是什么，但是他们很高兴地合着音乐跳舞：

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQLjFKiPGAk?list=PLck1JSQ7ZKKQbBF5V8Iicz_5ZWDVRMuiP" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

>Singing and dancing to Disney songs with North Korean
>
>和朝鲜人一起就着迪斯尼音乐跳舞

This was such a fun, beautiful, human moment. Sure, there’s always a chance that this entire experience was staged. In North Korea, you can never be sure. But I find it highly unlikely, given that there were thousands of people in the park that day, and how improbable it was that out of all those people, I would have picked this particular group of folks to do a dance-off.

这是如此有趣，美好而人性的一幕。的确，这一切的开始，总有那么些机缘巧合的意味。在朝鲜，你总不能百分之百确信会发生什么。但我总觉得，因为当时在公园里有数千人，要碰巧碰到“那些”人，还和他们一起跳舞，机会是多么的渺茫。这很不可能。

Definitely one of the top highlights of my trip.

这的确是我这次旅行中，最棒的亮点之一。

###The Mass Dance

**集体舞**

My second trip highlight took place on the country’s National Day holiday (September 9, 2015). To celebrate, Mass Dances were held all over the country. A Mass Dance is basically when hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of Koreans dress up in their finest clothes, and gather in a public space for synchronized dancing.

我旅行的第二个亮点是在朝鲜的国庆节（9月9日）这一天。全国在这天都会举行大规模的集体舞，纪念这一节日。集体舞基本上就是数百人一起，而在有些时候，会有数千朝鲜人穿上他们最好的衣服，聚在公共场所一同跳舞。

That afternoon, we went to watch the largest Mass Dance in Pyongyang. There were well over 1,000 locals gathered here. The tableau was really stunning. A seemingly endless expanse of multi-colored hanbok dresses transformed the public square into a floral rainbow of colors and movement.

那天下午，我们去看了平壤最大规模的集体舞。那里应该聚集了超过1000的本地人。场面很生动很漂亮。五颜六色的韩服一眼望不到边，将公共广场变成了色彩和运动的绚烂彩虹

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/2000/1*xz4wVR4_CqWcDW6w0X0vuw.jpeg)

Like many things in North Korea, the event was very rehearsed. Between songs, the Koreans would line up like soldiers in a perfectly regimented grid. They would stand there silently, staring forward, waiting for the next song to begin. It was honestly a bit unnerving.

正如朝鲜的很多事情一样，整个活动经过了大量的排练。在歌曲的间隙，这些朝鲜人就像士兵似的，成方阵分组站立。他们就那样站着，目视前方，等待下一首歌开始。说实话，整个场面有些紧张。

![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1000/1*IaglcpSFl7dqJjUgQDKhdA.jpeg)

>国庆日跳集体舞的舞者 正等待下一首曲子开始

Also, I barely saw anyone smiling, even during the dancing. I got the sense that some of the folks may have been there more out of obligation than choice.

同样，我鲜见有人露出笑容，哪怕是在跳舞的时候。我明白了那里面有些人是收到了命令来跳舞的，而不是自愿的。

>Beautiful colors, but not a lot of smiles at the 9.9.15 Mass Dance

>国庆日集体舞，颜色很美，但是笑容不多

However, the Mass Dance was still such a unique experience to behold. And then things got even more fun when we were told that we could join in if we wanted to. Most of the tourists held back, but our group happily jumped in.

然而，这次集体舞还算是一次独特的体验，值得一看。而他们还告诉我们，如果我们想去的话，可以加入他们一起跳，更显得有意思了。大多数的游客都退缩了，但我们这一行人快乐地投入其中。

I asked one of the friendlier-looking dancers if I could cut in, and she shyly agreed. The dance moves were relatively straight-forward, and I did my best to blend in without stepping on my partner’s toes:

我问了个看起来比较友好的舞者，问她我能不能加进来，她有点害羞地同意了。舞蹈的动作很直白，而我尽了我最大的努力和她配合，同时避免在跳的时候踩到人家的脚趾。

It was thrilling to be so easily accepted into this massive, colorful event, and even more thrilling (and unexpected) to find myself dancing with a North Korean stranger. None of this was even remotely close to what I had expected when I first signed up to come here.

如此容易就被这场大型而多彩的活动所接纳，真心让人激动。而使人更为激动的意外在于我竟然在和朝鲜的一个陌生人在一起跳舞。这一切都与我决定报名来参加这次旅行时的预期完全不同。

### Freedom Walk

**自由行**

The final trip highlight took place earlier that same day, on September 9. As I mentioned before, we were almost never allowed to walk around outside on the streets. I can only assume that this was to minimize any chances of us having illegal contact with the locals.

最后一个亮点来自同一天（9月9号）。如我之前所说，我们基本上是被严禁在街上走动的。我想到的唯一一个解释只能是为了将我们与朝鲜当地人进行非法接触的可能降到最低。

However, after a couple days of building trust and good will with our minders, they gave us permission to do a short walk outside in Pyongyang. We would still have to stick together as a group, and we would only be walking for about 10 blocks. But let me tell you something: for those 10 blocks, the air never smelled sweeter, and the sun never shone brighter.

但是，由于我们努力在过去的数日中和我们的监视员增进互信，表达善意，于是他们允许了我们在平壤市区进行短暂的走动。我们还是得结伴而行，并且只能走大概10个街区。但是我可给你说，在这10个街区里，空气从未如此清新，阳光从未如此明媚……

For two days, we had been essentially cooped up and held prisoner in our hotel and shuttle bus. And now, for the next 15 minutes, we could roam the streets like normal people (almost). On this day, I learned:

满打满算，我们基本上是在我们的酒店和大巴里被关押了（折合）两天。而现在，在接下来的15分钟内，我们（基本上）可以像常人一样，在街上任意游荡。这一天，我学到的道理是：

<blockquote name="fe6c" id="fe6c" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">You can’t fully appreciate freedom until you’ve lost it
自由——直到失去了 你才会懂得珍惜</blockquote>

During our walk, I got to peer into windows, peek into storefronts, and mingle amongst everyday life in the DPRK.

在我们游荡的过程中，我看到了屋子窗户里面，看到了小商店的柜台，并且将我亲眼所见，与朝鲜的日常生活进行结合。

我在这次行走的过程中拍了一些视频。如果你想亲眼见见世界知名的朝鲜交通女警的话，你就从头看到尾吧：

## Hope

**希冀**

9 out of 10 people we saw in North Korea steered clear of us. However, making that occasional connection with the remaining 10% was so much fun. Sometimes, a smile would be returned, or, if we were really lucky, a wave. Almost all the time, these exchanges would be with kids or students.

在朝鲜，十个人当中有九个会直愣愣地盯着我们（我觉得这里可能写错了单词——译者注）。但是，偶尔与那其余的10%的人进行交流就很有意思。有时候，他们会还你一个微笑，或者如果我们足够幸运的话，他们会对我们挥挥手。基本上每次，这些交流都会是和孩子们或者学生们。

>Exchanging smiles in North Korea
>
>与朝鲜人互相以笑致意

I suppose it’s not too surprising that children and teenagers were far friendlier and more curious, compared to the adults. Perhaps they hadn’t been fully-indoctrinated by propaganda yet. Perhaps the hardships of life hadn’t begun weighing down on their shoulders.

我想，也许是因为孩子和少年人远比大人们友好得多，也好奇得多。这一点我并不觉得惊奇。也许，他们的思想还没有完全被强行灌输的各种宣传所熏染。也许，生活的重担还没有开始加在他们的双肩上……

Whatever the reason, seeing this next generation of North Koreans gave me hope — hope that someday, change will come for the North Koreans. And when it does, their country, and the entire world, will be better for it.

无论原因为何，看见这些下一代的朝鲜人给予了我希望——希望有一天，朝鲜人的境况会发生改变。而当这改变到来之日，全世界都会因之变得更加美好。
