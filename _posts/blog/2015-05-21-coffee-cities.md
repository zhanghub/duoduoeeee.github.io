# Living in: The world's top coffee cities

**生活：全球顶级的咖啡城市**

These six cities are known for their top-notch brews and caffeine-focused cultures – perfect for those on an extended stay.

以下六个城市因其一流的酿造饮料和以咖啡类为中心的文化而赫赫有名。对于要待的时间稍长的游客再好不过。

**By Lindsey Galloway**

In many of the world's top coffee cities, the cafe is more than just a place to get a warm drink – it is also a hub of culture and conversation for locals and visitors alike. And while each city defines its coffee culture in a different way – whether it be by their classic drink style or by the sheer concentration of independently owned coffee houses – these six cities, taken from “best of” lists in publications including Travel and Leisure and the USA Today, have one thing in common: the cities are filled with people who live for the craft of coffee.

在很多世界顶级咖啡城市中，咖啡馆已不仅仅是一个能喝热饮料的场所——它还算是一个当地人和游客之流互通文化，互致问候的中心了。这些城市以各自不同的方式定义着它们的咖啡文化，标准从它们的传统咖啡类型，到它们独有咖啡屋的浓缩纯度——这七座从像《旅游与休闲》和《今日美国》这样的杂志里的“最佳”排位中选拣出的城市有一处相通——这些城市当中都满是为咖啡艺术而生的人。

## Taipei, Taiwan

**台湾岛，台北**

Taipei residents are known for being extraordinarily friendly and extremely polite. Since the island was once a Japanese colony, it is not uncommon for shop employees to smile and bow in unison when someone walks through the doors. And nowhere is this friendliness more apparent than in the city's surprisingly unique cafes. Topo Cafe, in northern Taipei's Western-style Tianmu neighbourhood, is so offbeat it has a miniature, gold-fish filled river  running through the middle of it.

台北居民以他们超常的友善以及礼貌而著称于世。由于台湾岛曾经是日本殖民地，所以当有人走进店门的时候，店内店员统一微笑鞠躬并不鲜见。而要说哪里最为友好，那必然是市内令人惊艳的独特咖啡馆了。台北北部的西式士林区有一家拓朴咖啡，甚是不落俗套——咖啡店的中间有一条放养金鱼的微缩版河流流过。

Allister Chang, an American from the Washington DC area, lived in Taipei for a year, documenting his favourite coffee spots on his blog, Taipei Cafes. He said he especially loves the establishments near the Zhongxiao Dunhua transit station in southern Taipei's Da'an district. “These cafes are a little bolder,” he explained in an e-mail. “Homey's Cafe, for example, requires you to walk up two unmarked, sketchy cement stairs to find, while the Barbie Cafe is exactly what the title suggests: completely pink.”

Allister Chang​来自美国华盛顿特区，在台北居住已有一年。他在他的博客“台北咖啡馆”上记录他最喜欢去的咖啡店。他说他特别喜欢去台北南部大安区忠孝敦化站附近的几家。“这些咖啡店都有些自信而大胆，”他在一封email中解释道，“例如Homey's Cafe，你得要走上两段没有标记的简朴水泥台阶才能找到；还有一家Barbie Cafe的确名副其实：它完全是粉色的。”

Apartments near the station range from studios to three-bedrooms, and are modern with no extra frills, though they can still be on the expensive side. With no shortage of entertainment options, the Da'an district has lots of shopping, restaurants and is famous for the Tonghua and Shida night markets, where street vendors serve up budget-friendly snacks and gadgets.

敦化站附近的公寓，从​设计室到三卧室各种都有，均为现代化建筑，一点多余的装饰都没有。即便如此，它们仍属于一线的价位。大安区并不缺乏玩乐去处，那里有大量的购物市场供人娱乐，尤以通化和师大夜市最为有名，那里街边小贩提供便宜的小吃和小物件。

There's a particularly strong cafe culture near the National Taiwan University in Da'an. “This movement to create independent cafes in Taipei has really been driven by the younger generation,” Chang said. One of the district's more popular spots is The Puzzle Cafe (022-362-0859; number 28, Lane 44, Tàishùn St), where friends can catch up over cappuccino and a 500-piece puzzle. Housing here caters to mostly students, so apartments tend to be on the smaller, simpler and more affordable side.

大安区接近国立大学那里，咖啡文化尤为浓厚。“在台北创立独立咖啡店的这一运动实质上是由年轻一代推动开展的，”Allister Chang说道。该地区最著名经典之一为拼图咖啡馆。学生们可以在那里约起喝卡布奇诺，并且拼500片的拼图。而由于那里的住房要迎合多数的学生，所以那里的公寓多为开间更小，更简单，也更便宜的类型。

##Melbourne, Australia

**澳大利亚，墨尔本**

Australia's second largest city has the reputation for being friendlier than Sydney or Perth, and offers plenty of activities without having the frenetic energy of many other big cities. “We don't chortle 'good morning' at each other, but we're not afraid to make eye contact either,” explained Lou Pardi, a writer for the Melbourne Review newspaper.

作为澳大利亚第二大城市，墨尔本因比悉尼和珀斯更为友好而广受赞誉。此外，在这座城市里并不必像在其它大城市里那么忙乱，就可以拥有充足的活动。“我们并不需要开怀大笑向对方问好，但我们也并不惧怕眼神的接触。”《墨尔本评论》报纸作家Lou Pardi解释说。

The city is broken up into areas called "villages", each of which has its own vibe. “Fitzroy is traditionally edgy and grungy, Richmond has a Vietnamese and Greek influence, Coburg is Lebanese and Turkish and Brunswick is the hipster capital,” said Mike Dundon, owner of Seven Seeds Coffee in the village of Carlton.

墨尔本被分割成叫做“村”的区域​，而各个“村”的氛围都有所不同。“像Fitzroy是一个传统的紧张不安而乏味的村，而Richmond村文化受到越南和希腊文化的影响，Coburg是黎巴嫩文化，Brunswick则是时尚首都，”Calton村“七种咖啡”店主Mike Dundon讲道。

No matter where you live, though, it is easy to find great coffee. Pardi recommended stopping by Sonido, a South American-themed cafe in Fitzroy, a village known for having cafes with highly skilled baristas. Housing in Fitzroy is as quirky as the district itself, and includes everything from traditional Victorian-style cottages to modern converted warehouse lofts.

但是，无论你在哪里居住，你总能很容易地找到好喝的咖啡。​Pardi推荐我们在Fitzroy的一家南美主题的咖啡店Sonido稍作停留。Fitzroy村以其咖啡店的调理师技艺精湛而远近闻名。而Fitzroy村的住房则像这个村本身一样古怪，建筑包括从传统维多利亚式茅草屋到改建成现代式的阁楼储藏间。

Also filled with creative types, Collingwood is one of Melbourne's oldest neighbourhoods, with many 19th-century buildings still in use as retail and apartment buildings. The village often puts an artistic spin on space, including the Collingwood Underground Theatre, which is housed in an abandoned car park underground.

而Collingwood村作为墨尔本历史最长的村，其咖啡店也满是创意四射的不同类型。那里还有很多用于零售和公寓楼的19世纪老建筑。该村经常创意性地使用空间，包括当地建于废弃地下停车场的地下剧院。

## Havana, Cuba

**古巴，哈瓦那**

Cuba's capital city is in the middle of a seismic economic shift, with the expansion of private enterprises and a boom in international tourism. Locals are proud of their national identity and happy to share their culture with travellers and expats alike.

古巴的首都​正处于一场经济地震的抬升之中，这伴随着私有企业的扩张和国际旅游业的繁荣。古巴当地人民对于他们的国家身份十分自豪，并很高兴能将他们的文化与游客和外国人民分享。

Much of the local energy seems to be underpinned by “cafe cubana”, the full-bodied espresso served with sugar that accompanies nearly every meal. “It is very easy to find really good cafe in Havana. Most restaurants and all paladares[privately owned restaurants] know how to deliver on cafe,” said Malia Evrette, the founder of social tour operator Altruvistas, who splits her time between Havana and California. And if you happen to be staying in a hotel for a few days while you get your bearings, she recommended that travellers seek out the espresso bar that most hotels will have in the back instead of settling for the bland, Cafe Americano-style coffee often served with breakfast.

当地经济活力的支柱似乎是“古巴咖啡”，这是一种具有浓烈味道的加糖咖啡。这种咖啡当地人几乎餐餐都喝。“在哈瓦那，好的咖啡馆随处可见。大多数（公立）餐馆和私营餐馆都会将咖啡和饭一起上。”说话的是社会旅游提供商Altruvistas的创始人Malia Evrette，她的大部分时间都花在哈瓦那和加利福尼亚。此外，如果你碰巧会在酒店住几天来寻找方向的话，她推荐旅游者去大多数酒店都有的浓咖啡馆，而不是喝那些淡而无味的美国咖啡馆式的早餐咖啡。

Dedicated coffee drinkers should look for apartments in La Habana Vieja (Old Havana) alongside some of the country's most historic buildings. Located on the eastern edge of the city, La Habana Vieja is filled with colonial-era houses and mansions situated alongside plazas and parks.

真正有献身精神的咖啡爱好者应该在老哈瓦那寻找栖身之处，那里有全国大多数的历史建筑。老哈瓦那就在哈瓦那的东沿，其广场和公园旁边随处可见殖民时代的房屋和各种公寓。

Despite its name, this area of the city still buzzes with young energy. With lots of bars and clubs, especially along the main drag of Calle Obispo, the nightlife runs into the early hours and the dancing sometimes even spills out into the streets.

撇开“老哈瓦那”这个名字不谈，哈瓦那的这一地带还是充满青春活力的。这里有很多酒吧和俱乐部，特别是在沿着Calle Obispo的主干道上，夜生活会持续到很晚，有时这里跳舞都会跳到大街上来。

## Vienna, Austria

**奥地利，维也纳**

As a one of Europe's smaller capital cities, Vienna offers the best of both worlds: the cultural amenities of a big metropolis with the affordable, well-kept housing of a smaller city. This environment also leads to a low-key, often independent vibe. While locals usually like to keep to themselves, they are friendly to visitors and often appreciate an outsider's view on culture and current events.

作为欧洲的小首都之一，维也纳提供两个方面的最佳体验：大都市便利的文化环境和小城市便宜稳定的房价。这一环境也造就了一种慢节奏的，（以至于）时常独立的氛围。当地居民通常偏向保守，他们待客友善，且通常愿意让外人评论他们的文化和时事。

The city's cafes make ideal spots for these types of conversations. "The Viennese value the fresh air of meeting visitors, including the musicians, conference attendees and those working for the UN,"said Eugene Quinn, an expat from London who organises monthly, English-language Vienna Coffeehouse Conversations.

市内的咖啡馆是讨论这些话题的理想场所。“维也纳人很看重​与游客的见面，这样可以吹到新鲜空气。比如音乐家、来此参会者，以及联合国官员。”Eugene Quinn说。他是从伦敦来的外国人，组织英语维也纳咖啡馆谈话，每月一次。

The grand old coffee houses (such as Cafe Central,Landtmann, Griensteindl and Demel) may be a draw for tourists, but locals like to gather at lesser known spots, such as Cafe Frauenhuber, Braunerhof or Sperlhof. “At least half of the customers will be regulars,” said Christina Pritz, who lives near Vienna's Augarten Park.

大型的老咖啡屋（像中央咖啡屋、Landtmann、Griensteindl还有Demel）可能很吸引游客，但是当地人喜欢去比较冷门一些的，例如Cafe Frauenhuber、Braunerhof或者是Sperlhof。“那里至少一半的顾客都是常客。”居民Christina Pritz说。他住在维也纳奥加登公园附近。

Both Pritz and Quinn said they like Cafe Phil in central Vienna's artsy 6th district, where books for either buying or borrowing line the walls and free concerts featuring groups with classical instruments or rotating DJs take place in the evenings. They also mentioned Cafe Hawelka, in the 1st district, where the small space often requires strangers to sit next to each other and meet.

Pritz和Quinn两人都说他们比较喜欢维也纳中心有艺术气息的6号区，那里随处可见供购买和借阅的书籍，晚上还有免费音乐会，题材有古典乐器、摇滚DJ等。他们还提到了Hawelka咖啡店，它在1号区。这是一家狭小的店，陌生人经常得排排坐，这样他们就能互相认识。

For those who want to be in walking distance of coffee shops, boutiques, restaurants and bars, Pritz recommended living in the 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th districts. “These areas are populated by families with kids as much as students, graduates and couples,” Pritz said. Families who prefer to live further out in some of the quieter areas can benefit from the city's comprehensive network of affordable public transportation.

对于那些想紧挨咖啡店、时装店、​餐厅和酒吧的人而言，Pritz推荐住在5，6，7，8号区。“这几区居住的主要是有孩子、学生、大学生的家庭，此外还有情侣～”Pritz说。市内有完善便宜的公共交通网络，居住得离市中心较远的安静地区的家庭可以从中获益。

## Seattle, United States

**美国，西雅图**

No list of coffee cities would be complete without including the city that launched the world's largest coffee chain. But even though Seattle is known globally for Starbucks, many locals prefer the independent spots that feature local art on the walls and fair trade coffee in their cups.

要是一个咖啡城的单子里没有包括这座运营了全球最大的咖啡连锁店的城市，这个单子就是不完整的。而虽然西雅图为全球所知是因为星巴克，但是很多当地人还是更喜欢去独立的咖啡店——墙上挂有当地艺术画，而且杯里的咖啡不是那么贵的那种。

While Washington state residents are polite, outsiders say they often experience the “Seattle Freeze”, a quality that makes it hard to strike up spontaneous conversations with strangers and even harder to develop deeper relationships, even after living there for years. That said, there is an underlying sense of community. “The successes of one group in the city are seen as the collective success of the entire city,” said Dayl Eccles, who lives in the University District in Seattle's northeast. The sense of shared identity and pride most recently was evidenced when the city's residents came out in droves to celebrate the Seattle Seahawks winning the 2013 Super Bowl.

虽然华盛顿特区的居民很礼貌，但是外地人说他们经常经历到“西雅图冷场”——这使得要和陌生人进行随意的对话变得很难，遑论发展更深的关系了——即使在那里生活了几年之后，情况也一样如此。这种情况下，这里就有一种潜在的社区的感觉了。“城市里一个群体的成功会被看做整个城市的成功。”说话的是Dayl Eccles，住在西雅图东北的大学区。这种身份认同感和荣誉感最近一次得到见证是在上次，城市里居民成群结队涌出，庆祝西雅图海鹰队在2013年超级碗比赛中拔得头筹。

Much of Seattle's social life somehow revolves around the city's numerous cafes. “The sense of community in Seattle is housed where the coffee is brewed,” Eccles said. “That's where you go for dates, for meetings, to end and begin a night on the town, to end and begin your day, to study or to people watch.” Her personal favourite place is the University District's Cafe Allegro, the city's first espresso bar (established in 1975) and the birthplace of Starbucks' signature roast, developed by Cafe Allegro founder and roaster Dave Olson.

西雅图的很多社交生活不知为何是以该市大量的咖啡馆为中心的。“在西雅图，哪里煮咖啡，哪里就有集体感，”Eccles说，“那里是你去约会、与人见面、进行城市夜生活、开始或结束全新一天、学习或是看着人潮发呆的地方。”她个人最喜欢的地方是大学区的Allergo咖啡馆，那是全市最老的咖啡馆，建成于1975年，此外还有星巴克标志性烤肉的诞生地，这道烤肉是由Allergo咖啡馆的创始人和烧烤师Dave Olson做出的。

While any neighbourhood will have plenty of coffee options, Seattle residents feel very loyal to their particular district and tend not to move far once they have found their niche. Some of the more famous neighbourhoods include the funky Fremont (famous for its massive, under-the-bridge troll), the hip-but-family-friendly Ballard, and Queen Anne, named for its stately 1850s-era houses.  

西雅图的每一个社区都有足够种类的咖啡任人选择，而西雅图的居民对于他们特定区的咖啡十分忠诚，一旦找到了​他们称心的种类之后，便再也不会往更远的走了。一些更为有名的社区包括Funky Fremont（以大规模桥下垂钓出名）、hip-but-family-friendly Ballard，还有“安妮公主”（因其19世纪50年代房屋得名）。

## Rome, Italy

**意大利，罗马**

Words like “latte” “cappuccino” and “espresso” are all Italian, so it should come as no surprise that the country's capital overflows with cafe culture. While locals can seemed rushed and always on the go, most will slow down for their morning coffee ritual. “There is no such thing as coffee to go,” said Elizabeth Minchilli, who blogs about her experience living in Rome over the past 25 years. “Even while enjoyed standing up at the counter, drinking espresso is when you stop, enjoy what is in front of you, and chat with friends, the barista or the next person over.”

像“拿铁”“卡布奇诺”“​浓缩咖啡”这些词都是意大利语，故而意大利首都为咖啡馆文化所熏染也就不足为奇了。虽然当地人看起来总是很急切，一副“永远在路上”的样子，但是大多数罗马人还是会慢下来，享受他们早间咖啡的传统。“咖啡一定要加嘛，”Elizabeth Minchilli在她的博客上就她25年的罗马生活写道，“甚至可以享受站在柜台旁边的时间。无论你是在稍作停留，还是享受当下，亦或是与好友、咖啡店服务生还是别的什么人交谈。”

One of the most atmospheric areas to experience that temporary slow-down is in the centro storico, or historical centre. “Sitting down in an outdoor cafe, watching the people go by, has got to be one of the great luxuries of living in Rome,” Minchilli said. The chicest citizens congregate in Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina, near Parliament, while the more hip and laid-back flock to the Piazza Madonna dei Monti. The rione(neighbourhood) of Monti is especially known for its ever-changing line up of trendy boutiques, cafes and restaurants.   

要体验这种暂时的悠闲，最有氛围的地方之一便是​历史中心了。“坐在一个露天咖啡馆里面，就看着人群从你身边走过——这是在罗马生活所能得到的最佳奢侈享受之一了，”Minchilli说道。最与众不同的市民会聚集在Lucina接近议会的Piazza San Lorenzo，较为时髦而闲散的人则大量涌向山上的圣母小广场。广场四周则因四时不同的潮流时装、咖啡馆和餐厅而特别有名。

Whatever the cafe of choice, Italians share an unspoken rule of what drink to order when: cappuccino in the morning and only acaffe (espresso) after eating.

无论选择什么咖啡，意大利人都有一个关于点咖啡的不成文惯例：早晨点卡布奇诺，饭后点浓咖啡。

“Italians will poke fun at Englishmen or Americans who order a cappuccino after a big plate of pasta on a full stomach,” said Tess Amodeo-Vickery, an American singer-songwriter who has lived in Rome full-time since 2009. Later in the evening, the drink of choice iscaffe corretto, an espresso served with a shot of grappa or brandy – the perfect way to wind down for the night, or get a head start on the Roman nightlife.

“意大利人会挖苦那些吃完一顿饱饭点卡布奇诺的英国人和美国人，”说话的是Tess Amodeo-Vickery，他是一位自2009年起便长住在罗马的自创作歌手。之后，当天晚上，所选择的是一杯意大利渣酿白兰地——这是逐渐放松享受夜晚，或者开始罗马夜生活的绝好方式。
