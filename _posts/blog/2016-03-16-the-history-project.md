The internet already acts as a personal time capsule. Google allows us to measure the size of our digital footprint, while apps like Timehop show us what we were doing on Facebook and Twitter a year ago.

互联网已经充当了个人时光机。谷歌使得我们可以度量我们 “数字足迹” 的大小，而像 Timehop 这样的应用则可算是 Facebook 和 Twitter 的 “去年今日” 功能。

In that spirit comes The History Project, a new storytelling platform that launched Wednesday.

在本周三，一个全新的 “讲故事” 平台 The History Project 上线了，它秉承的就是以上理念。

The site allows users to create a digital timeline chronicling events that occurred both online and offline, giving them a full range of multimedia tools to tell their story. THP users can annotate their personal narratives by importing photos, videos, documents and social media posts.

用户可在该网站上创建一个数字化的时间轴，使用多种多媒体工具来记录线上线下发生的事件。用户还可以导入图片、视频、文档和社交媒体动态，更好地诠释他们所讲的故事。

The site began as a passion project for Niles Lichtenstein, who serves as the CEO of THP. Lichtenstein, 32, became inspired when he stumbled upon his late father's vinyl record collection.

现年 32 岁的 Niles Lichtenstein 是该网站的 CEO，他偶然发现了他已故父亲的黑胶录音碟，这点燃了他的灵感。

From there, Lichtenstein cobbled together as much information about his dad as he could, a process he described as "time-consuming and complex." The end result was a dropbox folder on his computer desktop with a bunch of media files.

从那以后，他尽他所能，搜集了有关他父亲的很多信息。他说这个过程很费时间，很复杂。最终的成果就是他电脑上的一个 Dropbox 文件夹，里面有一堆媒体文件。

"It felt very underwhelming," Lichtenstein said.

“我觉得这样没什么印象。”他说。

After discussions with friends, Lichtenstein sought to develop an alternative. And THP was born.

和他的朋友们讨论之后，Lichtenstein 便努力开发一种替代的方式，然后就有了这个网站的诞生。

He said that while "offline assets" are vanishing, "We have digital content that's created at such a rapid clip. They become these overflowing chronicles. If you or I were to disappear tomorrow, how would our stories be told?"

他说，一方面 “离线的资源” 会消失，另一方面 “我们可以非常快速地创建出数字内容。它们成了繁杂的编年史。如果你我明天就要消失，那我们的故事怎么讲啊？”

Unlike social media sites such as Facebook, Lichtenstein said that THP isn't meant for users to "overshare."

Lichtenstein 说 The History Project 并不是要用户去过度地分享。

"If there are 40 photos of you at a restaurant, maybe just choose one," Lichtenstein said.

“如果你下馆子的图片有 40 张，你只要取一张就好了。”他说。

His own personal timeline details his relationship with his wife. Their first date is commemorated with a screenshot of their first email correspondence, along with an audio recording of his wife describing the outing.

他在他自己的时间线上把他和他妻子的关系细细过了一遍。他描述他们的第一次约会，用了一张他们之间首次进行电邮联系的截图，外加一段他妻子描述此次约会的录音片段。

Users can create their own accounts for free, but THP also offers a paid version known as "concierge" through which a trained team of writers and artists will curate a timeline for anyone who lacks the technical skills. Lichtenstein said that THP will also begin teaching the technology at senior centers and retirement homes in the San Francisco area.

用户可以免费创建自己的账户，但是 The History Project 也提供一个收费的版本叫 “守门人”，让专业的作家和艺术家团队帮缺乏技术技巧的用户创建（并维护）时间线。Lichtenstein 表示他的网站也会着手教旧金山的养老院和老人之家（使用这个网站）。

"We found there was a really deep desire for this from people who were aging and didn't have the technical skills or didn't have the time," he said.

“我们发现对于上了年纪没有技术经验的人和一天闲不下来的人来说，这个需求很大。”他说。

Lichtenstein developed the site in a startup incubator with co-founder Ben Yee, and the two almost immediately drew interest from some big names. The musician Jewel has created a timeline to complement her autobiography, while HBO and the Dallas Morning News have used THP for promotional efforts. The New York Times is THP's lead investor.

Lichtenstein 和合伙人 Ben Yee 一起在创业孵化基地开发了这个项目。这两人很快吸引了一些名人的注意。音乐家 Jewel 创建了时间线，作为她自传的补充，而 HBO 和德拉斯晨报则把它用来做推广活动。纽约时报是该网站最大的投资人。

William Bardeen, senior vice president, strategy and development, at The New York Times Company, said that the investment was attractive "because it combines strong entrepreneurial leadership with a compelling market opportunity that is consistent with the mission of The New York Times company."

William Bardeen 是纽约时报的高级副主编（？），他说这个投资很吸引人，因为“它是强有力的企业主导和无可抗拒的市场机遇的结合，并与纽约时报的使命相符”。
