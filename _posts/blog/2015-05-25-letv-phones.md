When I describe Letv as the Netflix of China, Mark Li corrects me. "It's the other way around," he says. "Netflix is the Letv of the U.S."

我说乐视是中国的Netflix。“应该反过来说，”Mark Li纠正我说，“Netflix是美国的乐视。”

He has a point. Letv launched its Internet video streaming service three years before Netflix (2004 versus 2007). It was producing original movies and series long before Netflix rolled out House of Cards. And in recent years, the Chinese behemoth has expanded in ways Netflix hasn't: It sells TV settop boxes and smart TVs -- devices that can help you watch all that video. "We want to control the screens too," says Li, the ex-Googler who is head of data analytics at Letv, a company with a $12 billion market cap.

某种意义上说，他是对的。乐视网的网络流媒体服务比Netflix早开始了三年（两者分别是2004和2007年）。在Netflix发布纸牌屋之前，乐视就一直在生产原创电影和电视剧了。此外，在近几年，中国乐视这一巨头的扩张方式，是与Netflix大相径庭的：乐视销售电视机顶盒和智能电视——作为它服务的入口。“我们还想（直接）控制用户的屏幕。”Mark Li说道。他是乐视数据分析部门负责人，曾在谷歌工作。——乐视目前的市值为120亿美元。

What's more, the company soon will move into the United States, encroaching on Netflix. Li will lead the effort, bringing Letv's video streaming service, its original programming, its Apple-TV-like settop boxes, its smart TVs, and, now, smartphones.

除此之外，乐视很快将进入美国市场，这将挤占Netflix的份额。Mark Li将会带头，将乐视的流媒体视频服务、原创节目、以及形如Apple TV的机顶盒、智能电视、还有现在的智能手机，一并带入美国去。

Letv announced its entry into the Chinese smartphone market in April, and according to Li and his colleague JD Howard, the company plans to offer phones in the United States by year's end. "We're going to be building a big presence here," says Howard, a former executive with Chinese computer marker Lenovo, referring to the west coast of the United States.

今年4月，乐视宣布进入中国智能机市场。根据Mark Li 和他的同事JD Howard所言，乐视计划在年底将手机销往美国。“我们将会大大增加在当地市场的存在，”Howard说道，他指的是美国的西海岸。Howard曾身为中国电脑制造商标杆联想的高管。

It's an audacious move, given the dominance of Apple and Google in the stateside smartphone market -- and the limited track record of Chinese tech companies in the United States. But as Li and Howard explain it, Letv isn't a smartphone company. It's an Internet video company. The phones are a way of delivering video.

这是一次冒险的举动。因为苹果和谷歌占据并主导着美国的智能手机市场，且中国科技企业在美影响有限。但正如Mark Li和Howard解释的那样，乐视并不是一家智能机公司。它是一个互联网视频公司。手机只是提供视频的一种方式而已。

"What's going to be critical," Howard says, "is what you use your smartphone for."

“关键的问题在于，”Howard说道，“你用你的手机做什么。”

## The new wave

**新一波浪潮**

The company joins a wave of Chinese Internet companies eying the United States. E-commerce conglomerate Alibaba recently debuted on Wall Street (its market cap the day of its IPO exceeded that of Facebook, Amazon, and IBM), and it has invested in a handful of companies that operate in the United States. Search giant Baidu has an R&amp;D center in Silicon Valley. And Tencent, another sprawling Chinese Internet company, now has a U.S. partner to offer ebooks stateside.

中国的互联网企业现在瞄准了美国市场，而乐视也加入了这波滚滚洪流之中。电商集团阿里巴巴最近在华尔街首次露面，并投资了众多在美运营的公司。其首次公开募股当日的市值超过了Facebook、亚马逊和IBM。搜索巨头百度在硅谷有研发中心。还有腾讯，中国另一家正在扩张的互联网公司，现在与美国伙伴合作在全美销售电子书。

So many questions hang over the American aspirations of these Chinese companies -- and Li admits as much. But he and Howard aim to enter the U.S. market with a certain blend of patience and audacity. They will respect the unique nature of the market, they say, but also offer tools no one else has offered. "There is room for innovation," Howard says, "for offering a very different experience."

目前仍有很多问题横亘在这些中国企业进入美国的雄心壮志之前。这一点Mark Li 并不否认。但是他和Howard的目标在于，将耐心和胆识进行结合，从而打入美国市场。他们称，将会尊重美国市场的独特特点，同时还将提供其他人未曾提供的工具。“创新的空间还是有的，”Howard说，“为的是提供十分不同的体验。”

At the moment, Li and Howard say, their aims are modest. Basically, they see their phones as a way of delivering Chinese video to Chinese speakers in the United States. Then they may do much the same for people who've immigrated to the United States from other countries. "If you want to have a little taste of your home," Howard says, "you can have that." But the hope is that they can eventually reach the broader market. In addition to opening an office in Silicon Valley, Letv is setting up shop in L.A. to be close to the creators of the content its screens are made for.

接受采访时，Mark Li和Howard还称，他们的目标并不过分。他们总体上​将他们的手机视作为在美的中国人提供中文视频的方式。下一步，他们还可能向从其他国家移民去美国的人提供这种服务。Howard说：“如果你想小小地感受一把家的感觉，你就买一个吧。”但是他们的确有希望扩展到更广阔的市场。除在硅谷开设办公室之外，乐视还正在洛杉矶建立专卖店，以与目标市场的内容创建者近距离接触。

## A Formidable Task

**令人生畏的任务**

Still, the hurdles to entering the highly competitive U.S. smartphone market are enormous. "This is probably more work than they expect," says Dan Miller, the founder of research firm Opus Research, who closely follows the market. "Supply chains. Relationships. Getting room on retail shelves. As you go down the list, it becomes such a formidable task." Offering phones based on the Android operating system, Letv could face legal action from companies like Apple and Microsoft. And U.S. consumers may be wary of using devices that connect to machines in China. Many assume that Chinese companies freely share online data with the Chinese government, and the recent demand that Western tech companies provide Chinese authorities backdoor access to their hardware and software is hardly reassuring.

尽管如此，要进入高度竞争的美国智能机市场，还是有巨大的障碍的。“他们的付出可能要比预期高，”Dan Miller说道。他是奥普斯研究公司的创始人，并密切地关注着市场，“供应链、各方关系、零售店的开办，等等。按照这个单子下去，这就成了一个令人生畏的任务。”由于提供的手机基于安卓操作系统，乐视可能会面临诸如苹果和微软的法律行动。并且，美国消费者可能会提防这种会连接中国服务器的设备。很多人认为中国企业会无限制地与中国政府共享网络数据，最近还有针对西方国家科技公司向中国政府提供软硬件后门的要求，这就更令人不放心了。

But Li says that Letv will run its online services from servers in the United States, if need be. "We will do what is necessary to make the consumers feel like their rights are being protected," he says. And he points out that the company will offer more than phones, including settop boxes and smart TVs. In China, the company has even said it will offer electric cars. People watch TV shows and movies in cars too. It's the video, Li says, that will carry the company's devices forward.

但是，Mark Li表示，如果需要的话，乐视将会在美国服务器上运行其网络服务。他说：“我们会做一切必要的事情，让用户觉得他们的权利是受保护的。”他还指出，乐视不仅仅要提供手机，还会有机顶盒和智能电视。乐视在中国甚至声称其将发售电动汽车——人们也会在汽车里观看电视节目和视频。Mark Li说，视频（内容）将会把乐视的设备不断推向前进。

That may or may not offer a path to success. Remember: Amazon, another stateside company that does streaming online video, recently tried and failed to crack the smartphone market (its tablets and e-readers do okay). But Letv's arrival shouldn't be discounted out of hand. The company is playing the long game. Given its success in China, it has the resources to do so. And the same could be said for more than one Chinese tech giant on the edge of the U.S. market. American consumers -- and companies -- are used to their gadgets being made in China. Chinese brands may not be far behind.

乐视手机进入美国，可能会成功，但也不尽然。需要记住的是，另一家美国公司亚马逊，也提供在线流媒体服务，它最近尝试打入手机市场，但未能成功（它的平板和阅读器产品表现尚可）。然而，乐视的到来却不能被简单地低估。乐视是在放长线钓大鱼。而对于仍处于美国市场边缘的不止一家中国网络巨人来说亦是如此。美国的消费者和企业已经习惯了他们的设备是中国造。中国品牌其实并非技不如人。
