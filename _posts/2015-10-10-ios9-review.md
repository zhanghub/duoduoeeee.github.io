iOS 9 is deceptive. When Apple first publicly trotted out the update at WWDC a few months back, it seemed happy to hang its hat on just a few new features: Apple News, better Maps and an improved Notes app. After using the betas for months and putting in still more time with the final, ready-for-everyone build, though, it's clear that what Apple built is far more nuanced than it might have let on. (And there I was, thinking I'd have an easy review to write. Silly me.) Instead, what we've got here is in some ways a continuation of a philosophy that seemed to start in earnest in the Apple Watch. iOS 9 is less about new, whizbang features and more about getting the stuff we do everyday done just a little quicker, a little more efficiently. And you know what? That's more valuable than you might think.

iOS9具有误导性。几个月之前，当在WWDC上向公众展示这款系统的时候，看起来苹果仅仅加了几个新功能——苹果新闻、改进版地图、改进版便签应用——就给它扣上了ios9的帽子。我用了几个月的测试版系统，还花了更多的时间用最终的量产版，尽管如此，还是不难看出苹果的新系统比起苹果自己透露的情况，更像是小修小补。（呃然后我想我这篇评测写起来应该很简单，看来我想多了。。）但正与此相反，我们所看见的，在某种程度上讲，的确是从苹果推出Apple Watch时那种哲学的延续。ios9并没有太多新的花里胡哨的功能。它更为关注的是使我们的日常事务完成得更快捷，更有效。你要知道，这比你想象的要更有价值。

## Getting started
**上手体验**

（尝试性地植入视频：）
<div style='text-align:center'><script type='text/javascript' src='https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?sid=281&width=480&height=401&playList=519100031'></script><br/></div>

Download. Install. Boot. Setting up iOS 9 follows the same streamlined approach you're probably already used to (unless you're one of those people who habitually stays a version or two behind just because). The differences here are minor: Apple really wants you to set up a six-digit passcode instead of the standard, not-terribly secure four-digit alternative, although you can still choose the latter if you're not too concerned about security. (Side note: You probably should be.) Of course, this is all moot if you can't actually complete the update thanks to a bug that could strike post-install. Some users are reporting that they can't use [the "Slide to Upgrade" gesture](http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/18/how-to-fix-slide-to-upgrade-error-ios-9/) after the iDevice restarts, prompting Apple to issue [emergency suggestions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205239) while it works on a fix.

下载，安装，启动。iOS9的安装仍然遵循同样直线化的老套路——而你应早已习惯（除非你是那种习惯性地落后一两个版本的人，仅仅因为你习惯）。这里的改动并不大——苹果确实希望你设一个6位数的密码，替代之前不是那么安全的标准四位数密码。当然如果你对安全性并不那么在意的话，你也可以选择后者。（旁注：你应该会在意安全性的。）然而，由于有个bug会影响到后期安装，你很可能无法完成系统更新——若真的如此，那刚刚说的都没什么卵用了。部分用户报告称，设备重启之后他们无法使用[“滑动来更新”手势](http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/18/how-to-fix-slide-to-upgrade-error-ios-9/)，这使得苹果发表了[紧急建议](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205239)，同时修补bug。

Anyway, before you even get to your home screen, you might notice all the text looks a little different. After years of Helvetica Neue in our faces, Apple swapped in its San Francisco typeface (first used on the Watch) and it very subtly changes the feel of iOS. It's sort of like walking into your living room and seeing that your maroon walls are suddenly just a hair lighter than they used to be. I'll leave it to the font buffs to debate the relative merits of Helvetica versus San Francisco, because the rest of us won't find much to get worked up about. (I've come to really like it.)

无论如何，在你来到你的主屏幕之前，你可能会注意到所有的字变得和之前有点点不同。我们看惯了几年的Helvetica Neue字体被苹果换成了San Francisco（它首先被采用在Apple WAtch上。）它甚为微妙地改变了iOS的观感。这种感觉就像是你走进你家客厅，看见你紫褐色墙壁的颜色突然比之前淡了那么一点点。我会把这个话题留给字体迷们来辩论Helvetica和San Francisco的优劣，因为我们其他人没有研究这玩意的动力。（我还是很喜欢这个字体的。）

San Francisco aside, your home screens have hardly changed, so anyone hoping for a radical, iOS 7-level redesign will have to wait a few more years. That's not to say Apple left its now-standard aesthetic completely unchanged: Alerts and action boxes have slightly rounder corners (I call them "jelly beans"). The Notification Center displays your missed missives and calls in reverse chronological order, making it easier for you to triage from the top down. Oh, and there's a battery widget that now lives in the Today screen, letting you know how much juice remains in your device (and Apple Watch, if you have one). This is all pretty minor stuff that does little to change the core of the iOS aesthetic, but it does reflect an understanding that people want information to be easier to find and digest.

先把San Francisco放到一边。你的主屏几乎没有改动，所以那些希望有一个彻底的,像iOS7那样的重新设计的人，你得再多等几年。但这并不意味着苹果完全保持了它现行的审美标准不变：提示框和动作框（译者：这什么玩意。。）的四角稍微圆滑了些（我把这些叫做“果冻豆”）。通知中心会将你的未接电话和未读信息按时间倒序排列。这样你从上往下分类的时候为容易。呃还有，今日视图里现在有了电池小控件，你可以了解你的设备还剩多少“油水”。（电量还会在你的手表上显示——如果你有的话。）这些对于iOS观感的改动都很细小，但是这的确体现了一种考虑，即人们想更容易找到并使用信息。

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/17d09495a733db8e902b1a4c9f7b692d/202671519/appgif-compressor.gif)

Turns out the biggest visual change is also the one you're going to use most often. Double-tapping the home button brings up a revamped app switcher that's much prettier than the original. Rather than the usual, flat app screenshots aligned side by side, we now have a layered, three-quarter view that stacks apps on top of each other for snazzier perusing. It's certainly a huge aesthetic improvement; peer closely enough and you can make out four apps running at a time, and just about every card has an up-to-date preview of what you were doing before you suddenly jumped somewhere else. I was no fan of the ugly, blank cards that populated iOS 8's app switcher, and Apple clearly wasn't either as they've been fixed (even if it sometimes takes a second for them to update). In fairness, the whole thing feels a little like the app-switching implementation in recent versions of Android. Whatever: It works well.

于是，iOS9视觉上最大的改动正好也是你会频繁使用的。双击home键调出的多任务切换经过了重新设计，比之前看起来更漂亮了。之前的多任务视图是一个个平面的应用截图排成一排，而现在，多任务是分层的四分之三视图（见动图），看起来更有吸引力。这的确是一次重大的审美上的改进。细看之下，你可以同时运行四个应用，且在你突然跳转到其他地方之前，几乎每个应用卡片都能显示及时的屏幕预览。我对ios8的多任务界面满是白色卡片一点都不喜欢，而且苹果显然也不喜欢，所以他们改好了这个问题（虽然有时候它们要更新屏幕需要一秒的时间）。其实说句公道话，新版的多任务有点点像是采用了近几个android版本中的多任务设计。但无论如何，它的表现很好。

Biggest is one thing, but the best design tweak in all of iOS 9 is the one that's easiest to miss. If you follow a link in one app into a completely separate one, the carrier/WiFi signal readout in the top-left corner of the screen disappears entirely, replaced by a handy "Back to [insert app here]" button that whisks you back one step along a trail of behavioral breadcrumbs. It's one of those little, "oh duh" things that belonged in iOS from the start, and indeed, I predict you'll be using it all the time.

多任务页面变得更加大气了这是一件事情，而iOS9中所做的最好的一项设计上的调整，同时也是最易被忽略的一点，就是，如果你在一个应用里点了一个链接，跳到了另外一个应用里时，屏幕左上角的运营商/wifi的显示会完全消失，取而代之的是一个十分顺手的“返回上个应用”的按钮，把你切回到常用应用列表中的上一个应用去。这是iOS9中令人觉得惊奇的细节调整中的一部分，而且，我预计你会很频繁地使用这个功能的，真的。

And then there's the keyboard. I can't count the number of times I've accidentally SHOUTED at friends via text because there wasn't any visual feedback worth a damn when I tapped the Shift button one time too many. Not so anymore. The letters on the keyboard visually switch between caps and lowercase depending on what you do with the Shift key, which itself changes color when you tap it. It's about time: My friends and colleagues might finally believe I'm not a jerk. I won't be the first bearer of bad news, but it's worth repeating: There are no new emoji in iOS 9. You'll have to [wait for 9.1 to drop](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/10/apple-ios-9-1-public-beta/) later this year before you can deploy your tacos and middle fingers mid-conversation.

然后该说说键盘了。我已经记不清我有多少次一不小心把键盘调成大写，从而让我的朋友认为我在大喊大叫了，因为我敲shift键改变大小写的时候，那个键盘尼玛的一点视觉反馈都没有。但是这都是过去式了。现在键盘上的字母会随着你按shift改变大小写而自动切换，而同时shift键自身也会改变颜色。是时候改变一波我在朋友心目中形象的时候了，我的朋友再不会认为我是个粗浅的人了。还有个坏消息不得不提——虽然我不是第一个听说这个消息的人——iOS9中没有emoji表情了。在9.1版发布之前，你没法再在聊天中直接插入emoji表情了。

## More mindful of your space
**更为你的空间着想**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/56655b51cd9ac556941e6aa5a404cc8d/202682731/things.jpg)

When Apple launched iOS 8, plenty of people had a serious decision to make: Delete apps and content to make room for that huge install file, or hold off on updating indefinitely. Thankfully, that's way less of an issue this year. If you've already downloaded iOS 9, you might've noticed the size of the update is much smaller than it used to be -- it takes up 1.3GB of space, down from the hefty 4.6GB or so that iOS 8 required. Apple insisted on keeping 16GB iPhones around for at least another year rather than sticking 32GB into the entry-level model, and leaner updates will help keep people from having to make that agonizing choice again. To that end, Apple is also pushing what it calls "App Slicing," a way for developers to tag the parts of their apps meant for devices other than yours -- install one of those apps and you'll only get the stuff meant for you.

苹果发布iOS8的时候，很多人不得不做出一个艰难的决定——是删除些软件和内容，给那个巨大的升级文件腾地方，还是等等再升级。谢天谢地，今年这个问题算是大事化小了。如果你已经下载了这次的更新的话，你可能已经注意到更新的大小比之前的小得多了——新的更新占用1.3GB的空间，比之前iOS8巨无霸般的大概4.6GB有所下降。看来苹果坚持让16GB的iPhone在市场上再多待至少一年，而不是强行让32GB版成为入门机型。而且，更新体积的减小使得人们不必再做出如此艰难的决定了。为此，苹果还推出了叫做“应用分块”的功能，让开发者标出他们应用当中不适配你设备的部分，而安装这种应用的话，你只会得到你用得上的部分。

## A smarter Siri
**Siri更为智能**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/666f50660352a7ac9ca90105290f089e/202673521/siri.jpg)

Apple's virtual concierge gets a little more capable with every update, and this time around it has a new look to go with its new tricks. The new Siri manifests in the form of a friendly, multicolored waveform (lifted from the Apple Watch) that pulses and surges in response to your voice. More importantly, Siri is starting to act more like an honest-to-goodness assistant thanks to some new contextual smarts. Go ahead, ask it to remind you of "this" while reading an article in Safari -- Siri can figure out what you're looking at and create the appropriate event for whenever you ask. I've mostly been using this feature to build an impromptu reading list and sure enough, it works like a treat. Siri can now also handle more specific tasks, like showing you photos from a specific time or location. Asking Siri to show off all my photos taken in 2014, or around here, or from Vietnam is a neat -- and helpful -- party trick. Not to mention, it sure beats sifting through the wilds of my Camera Roll.

每次系统升级，Siri都会学到一点点新技能，而这一次，它在学到新技能的同时，外观也得到了更新。新的Siri界面上采用了更为友好的彩色声音波形图（从苹果表上直接搬来的），它会随着你说话的声音波动起伏。而更为重要的是，现在由于采用了一些新的上下文分析技术，Siri的表现更像是你地地道道的左膀右臂。你可以直接在Safari里阅读文章的时候让Siri提醒你“这件事”——Siri自己知道你正在浏览的内容，并且随时根据你的要求在日历中创建合适的事件。这个功能我经常用来添加临时阅读列表。当然，它工作得甚好。Siri现在还能处理更为具体的任务，比如显示特定时间和地点拍的照片。让Siri显示我2014年拍的、或者是在这附近、或者是在越南拍的所有照片——这是一项智能而方便的功能，还能在朋友聚会上显摆一番。更不用说它与我在我的手机相册里翻来翻去相比，有多么大的优越性了。

But what about all the [Proactive stuff](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/apple-siri-answer-to-google-now/) Apple was talking up? You'll see what it meant when you dig into the new search interface by swiping down or right on your home screen. While you're going about your business, Siri quietly keeps tabs on what you're doing to get a sense of who you like to talk to, what apps you like to use and when you like to use them. Once it's done chewing on those behaviors, you'll start getting Siri Suggestions for apps and contacts when it thinks they're appropriate. Ideally, those suggestions would turn the search screen into a de facto, eight-icon quick-launch area (there's that efficiency angle again).

而苹果[主动提到的那些功能](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/apple-siri-answer-to-google-now/)怎么样啊？当你发现你可以通过在主屏幕向下或者向右滑动都可以打开那个新的搜索界面的时候，你就知道这个操作的含义了。当你在完成你的工作的时候，Siri会静默地收集你的行为，这样它能知道你喜欢和谁联系，以及你在什么时间喜欢使用什么应用。当它理解了你的习惯之后，你就会收到Siri推荐的联系人和应用，这些结果都是Siri“认为”时机适合的。事实上，在理想状态下，启用Siri建议后，搜索页将会变成一个有8个图标的快速启动区（这个又是从加强效率的角度看的）。

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/96d47890ae5c301ee29c932fda0160ce/202673732/siri-suggestions.jpg)

The end result? Mixed. Siri's very good at giving my girlfriend and sister Most Favored Contact status while the people I've spoken to most recently take up the other two slots. The app suggestions can be hit-or-miss, though -- I don't need Automatic when I'm sitting on the couch -- but they're better in the app switcher. Sometimes you'll get a single suggestion (in the bottom-left corner) when you try to multitask, which Siri very often nails. NJTransit when I'm pulling into a train station parking garage? Spotify when I'm walking to the office? Yes, please.

最后的结果呢：iOS实现了聚合。Siri擅长给我的女票和姐姐推送常用联系人状态，而最近和我联系的人则会占满剩下的两个槽，但应用建议可能无法保证准确——我坐在沙发上的时候可不需要自动推荐——而在多应用切换功能中，这个功能表现得要好些。有时你试着切换任务的时候，会在左下角看到一项建议。Siri一般会询问你：“车进火车站停车场的时候启用transit？” “我走进办公室时启用Spotify？”——是的，照做吧。

Siri also finally learned to listen for your voice; when your iPhone is connected to a power source, you can get its attention with a quick "Hey Siri." You'll have to train it to listen for your voice specifically using a quick setup procedure that involves saying the launch phrase a few times. Now that I've done that, I'm pleased with its attentiveness even in mildly loud environs. I'd love for Siri to be able to listen for my commands all the time like the Moto X's equivalents can, and it can do just that... as long as a hardware upgrade is in your future. Apple says the improved M9 co-processor wedged into the new phones' A9 chipset makes efficient, always-on listening possible on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but anyone using a current-gen 6 or something older will have to stay tethered to a power outlet. Keep a Mophie or some such handy if you really need to bark commands at Siri on the go.

Siri还最终学会了识别你的语音——当你的iPhone连着电源的时候，你可以直接喊“嘿，Siri”来唤醒它。你得用一套快速设置向导训练Siri，多说几次启动指令使其能够听懂你的特定语音。我做完这些之后，便很满意于Siri的识别精度，即使是在周遭环境杂音稍大的情况下。我很喜欢Siri能够始终聆听我的指令，就像moto X的类似产品一样，而Siri的确可以做到这点——只要你之后买个新手机就行了。。苹果声称，改进版的M9协处理器与新机型的A9处理器紧密结合，可以让iPhone6s和6s Plus实现Siri高效常开聆听指令，但是现在用着iPhone6或者早前版的iPhone的人得要让他们的机器连着电源才行。你要是非得在路上边走边给Siri下命令的话，还是连个移动电源之类的吧。

## Improved search

**改进了搜索功能**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/72ad1f649a03e71858646689573037df/202673564/searching-compressor.gif)

While we're at it, the line between Siri and Spotlight has started to blur, so let's shift our attention to search. Just like in iOS 8, Spotlight reaches deep into the Apple-owned parts of your iDevice. Consider the word "karaoke," which I think about abnormally often. Typing it into the search bar brings up apps I don't want, sent and received messages containing the word, a Maps suggestion for a karaoke bar in Philly, a contact with whom I've often used the word "karaoke," Bing search results for "karaoke" and so on. Here's the kicker, though: Developers can now let Spotlight peer into **_their_** apps and websites thanks to a trio of new APIs, so sources beyond Apple's first-party apps will eventually appear in your search results. That's... pretty exhaustive, but also a huge improvement.

我们注意到，Siri和spotlight之间的界限正在变得模糊。所以让我们把注意力放到搜索上吧。正如在ios8中一样，spotlight和苹果自家的应用做深度结合。比如卡拉OK这个词，我最近想得特别地多——我在搜索栏下键入这个词之后，会弹出我不想要的应用、收发的含有这个词的短信、必应上的搜索结果等。而且[kicker](http://www.kicker.com/)也来到了这里——由于iOS9采用了新的API组合，开发者们现在可以让spotlight搜索功能检索**_他们自己的_**应用和网站，所以苹果自家应用之外的信息来源也终将会出现在你的搜索结果中。这点……有些耗费资源，但是也算是一项重大的改进。

In days past, you could ask Siri about Amazon's stock price or what the weather's going to be like in Shenzhen and get a neat little visual readout of that info. Now you can feed those same queries -- along with things like basic math problems -- right into Spotlight and you'll get a quick answer too. Talking to Siri's a little faster, but it's still a nice feature to have. And since we're talking about talking, you can finally tap a microphone icon to speak them aloud, though you can't ask Siri to universally search your device for you. Guess we'll have something to look forward to in iOS 10.

之前，你可以向Siri询问亚马逊的股价或者深圳市的天气情况，还能看到这些信息的整洁输出。而现在除了这些之外，你还能问Siri基本的数学问题——直接将它们打入spotlight，你就会很快得到结果了。现在你给Siri讲话，得稍稍讲快些，但是这仍然是项不错的功能。而说到和Siri讲话，你现在终于能（在spotlight搜索里）按下话筒键，痛痛快快地说出来了——虽然这里你还是不能让Siri帮你搜索你设备里的内容。请尽情地想象下iOS10中会有什么令人期待的新功能吧。

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/49381206a161619ec6578bef6d4f1c0/202677612/searchios9.jpg)

Now dragging down from the home screen still reveals the Spotlight search bar (plus suggested apps), and it also lives in the dedicated search space to the left of your home screen. Siri's app and contact suggestions live there too, where they're joined by Maps buttons for local points of interest. Some of them are pretty pointless -- here's looking at you, Shopping -- but I've had to frantically use the Gas locator more times than I care to admit. Below all that is where you'll find articles culled straight from Apple's new News app. Well, most of the time, anyway. Sometimes they just don't appear and I can't make out the rationale here; it would've made sense if they didn't appear after just leaving Apple News, but that doesn't seem to be it either. Go figure.

现在，从主屏幕下拉仍然显示的是spotlight搜索栏（以及建议的应用程序）。而搜索栏还存在于你主屏左边专门的搜索页（见动图）。而这个专门的搜索页中还包含了Siri建议的应用和联系人，而它还和地图功能做结合来显示当地的兴趣热点（nearby）。有些推荐颇为不着边际——但是我还是频繁地使用“加油站位置”功能——比我所愿意承认的次数多得多。（在nearby）下面你则会看见直接从苹果新闻应用里拉取的新闻。呃——多数时候是这样的，有时候新闻并不会出现，我也找不出原因。。如果是因为刚刚离开新闻应用所以不用显示新闻倒还说得通，但是看起来原因也不在这里。。你们自己去研究吧。

## Apple News

**苹果新闻应用**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c30a2c3c8fddb82cdc58bef5cd4bc3c9/202679164/news2-compressor.gif)

If any one part of iOS 9 still feels like a work in progress, it's Apple's newfangled [News app](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/apple-news-app/). This update heralds the demise of Newsstand as we knew it, not that most people would notice; it was always one of those apps that seemed to wind up forgotten in some untouched folder. What we have instead is effectively a slick-looking RSS reader with some nifty bolt-on features and a bit of potential that isn't lived up to yet. The first few moments in the app will be spent picking out your preferred news sources and subjects, and then you're plopped into a list- (iPhone) or image-heavy grid (iPad) of stories to dig into. Pretty soon you'll notice a discrepancy in how some articles are handled -- most are just formatted text on a white background with the outlet's logo up top, but the few publishers that have already jumped on Apple's News format bandwagon are more visually sumptuous and smartly laid out. While you have the option of poking around different "news" channels and searching for new publications to follow, I'd wager most of your time will be in the For You section... for better or worse.

如果说ios9中的哪个部分看起来更像是个半成品的话，应该就是苹果全新的[新闻应用](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/apple-news-app/)了。这次的更新宣示着我们之前所知的newsstand的终结。现在人们都发现，newsstand看起来总是被我们放到一个从不去的文件夹里被我们所遗忘的那种应用。而这次我们看见的新闻应用则是一个高效的RSS阅读器，颜值也不错。它的功能很实用，但它（还得继续完善），充分开发自身的潜力。首次运行应用时，你得花一点时间选出你喜欢的新闻源和新闻主题，然后你就会跳转到一个列表中（如果是iPhone）或者一个多图的网格里（如果是iPad），里面列出了各种新闻可以点进去看。你会很快发现苹果新闻处理各种新闻之间的不同之处——绝大多数新闻都仅仅是将文字排在白色背景上，再加上一个新闻源的图标在上面，但是有少数几家媒体得到了苹果的特别关照，它们的新闻更为华丽，样式也更加漂亮。你尽可以四处闲逛，寻找不同的新闻源并且查找新的出版物并进行关注，但我可以打赌，你的大多数时间都会在看“为你推荐”栏目。。无论这意味着好或坏。

Let's take a step back for a second. Apple's been working to reconfigure its existing services into things that better cater to us, the users; a bunch of design changes in iOS 9 make the whole thing more intuitive, and the rise of the customized "For You" section in Apple Music is mirrored here in the News app. Unlike in Apple Music -- which has done a pretty great job of figuring out things I want to listen to based on my likes -- News hardly ever has a clue what I want to read. I've been dutifully "hearting" articles to give the app a sense of my tastes (which are pretty eclectic, in fairness), but the "For You" section continues to play home to things I just don't care about. Maybe it needs way more time to suss out my preferences. Maybe Apple needs to take things a step further with a "Hate" button to help fight the noise with negative feedback.

让我们再稍回头看看。苹果正努力实现自身服务的重新配置，来迎合我们用户的需要。iOS9带来的一系列设计上的改动使得整个系统更为直观，而且苹果音乐里自定义的“为你推荐”栏目的大受欢迎也在苹果新闻应用里得到了体现。——苹果音乐可以很好地从我的听歌偏好中得出我（可能）喜欢听的音乐，而苹果新闻应用却不像音乐那么出色，它几乎不知道我想看什么新闻，我不停地很SB地点红心收藏新闻，试图向我的应用传达我的口味（实话讲，这是很折衷的办法）。但是哪怕如此，苹果新闻“为你推荐”的栏目仍然是满页的我不关心的内容。它可能得要多得多的时间才能弄明白我的偏好。可能苹果得更进一步，加一个“讨厌”按钮帮助用户提出消极的反馈。

I don't mean to make Apple News sound like junk, because it's not. It's a fluid, perfectly usable RSS news tool and the promise of fancily formatted stories has the news nerd in me quivering in anticipation. Still, I'm curious how everyone else takes to it; news gets disseminated through so many other channels that a separate one-stop shop seems a bit redundant.

我并非有意将苹果新闻应用描绘成一堆垃圾，因为它自身并不是垃圾。它其实是一个可以使用的流畅的RSS新闻阅读工具，而苹果保证做好新闻的排版，也让我这个新闻书呆子在期待中高兴得发抖。而同时，我也很好奇其他人怎么看待这个应用。新闻可以通过那么多其他途径传播，再来一个“一站式商店”未免显得多余。

## Notes gets noteworthy, Maps figure out the subway

**便签应用值得一记 地图应用支持地铁**
![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c1c884750204dd8f2d37bca446ebbaec/202673505/notes-compressor.gif)

Sometimes Notes feels like one of iOS' unsung workhorses, so it's nice to see it finally getting some extra attention. Sure, you can still peck out your random thoughts (or in my case, ongoing karaoke list) and iOS 9 comes with formatting tools to add headers and full-blown checklists right into your notes. The added richness here isn't just textual, either. Adding photos or links to websites is dead-simple and brings some much-needed depth to what once was a bare-bones experience. And the really fun bit? A tap on a new squiggly icon brings up a proper doodling interface with three pen choices and eight colors. When the situation calls for more precision, there's an on-screen ruler to invoke that really helps nail those straight lines. Think of it as a software version of what Adobe did with its curious [Slide ruler](http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/18/adobe-ink-and-slide-review/).

有时候，便签应用像是iOS中一个幕后英雄（没什么人去关注它），所以现在看见它终于多吸引了些注意力，真的让人高兴。当然，你仍然可以用它记录日常随想（或者像我一样，用它来记卡拉OK的歌单=_=）。iOS9这次的更新带来了格式工具，可以直接在便签内容里添加标题抬头和功能完整的待办事项清单。而且添加进去的特性还不仅仅是纯文本，还有图片和网页链接——这些东西都极其简洁，为之前干巴巴的用户体验加入深度，而这种深度正是便签应用所需要的。而加入的特性中，最为有趣的在于，如果你点击一个弯弯绕形状的图标，可以进入一个（功能）恰到好处的涂鸦界面，可以选择三种笔刷，八种颜色。如果你需要更高的画图精度，你可以调用屏幕上的一个标尺，它的确有助于确定直线。你可以把它理解成Adobe神奇的[滑尺](http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/18/adobe-ink-and-slide-review/)的一个软件实现。

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/e14c4297633db08e69340791207319b1/202679232/maps.jpg)

Meanwhile, Apple Maps is closing the gap between itself and Google Maps with the addition of mass transit directions. I spent most of my time sussing out the quickest routes across Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the feature works just as well as you'd expect (although it means HopStop is now [about to shut down](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/13/apple-shutting-down-hopstop/)). The only times I got lost were when my own sense of direction got screwy and led me astray. The caveat: As of this writing, it only works in Baltimore, Beijing, Berlin, Chicago, Guangzhou, London, Mexico City, New York, Philadelphia, the SF Bay Area, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Toronto and the District of Columbia. Tap the search bar and you'll get a batch of eight location categories -- food, shopping, drinks, travel, services, fun, health and transport -- similar to the ones in Spotlight. One more tap on any of those icons reveals a list of Yelp listings nearby; think of it as a quick, at-a-glance way to sift through all the stuff around you.

除此之外，苹果地图添加了大量的transit导航数据，缩短了其与谷歌地图的差距。我用地图应用主要是找出从曼哈顿到布鲁克林的最短距离，而这项功能（transit）不会让你失望（尽管这意味着[HopStop服务要关闭了](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/13/apple-shutting-down-hopstop/)）。我迷路的唯一一种情况只可能是我自己的方向感不对，把我带偏了路。而至于caveat功能，截至我撰稿时它只能在如下几个地方使用：[巴尔的摩](http://www.bing.com/knows/search?q=%e5%b7%b4%e5%b0%94%e7%9a%84%e6%91%a9&mkt=zh-cn)、北京、柏林、芝加哥、广州、伦敦、墨西哥城、纽约、费城、三藩市湾区、上海、深圳、多伦多以及华盛顿特区。点击搜索框，你就会看见8项基于位置的分类（视图）：饮食、购物、饮料、出游、服务、娱乐、医疗以及交通——与spotlight当中的十分相似。再点这些图标则会出现“Yelp附近列表”，你可以把它理解成快速浏览你周围事物的一种方式。

## Safari

**Safari浏览器**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/4f33c0602f75013f8350aae43480694b/202682478/safari.jpg)

Safari doesn't have a huge changelog, but the few tweaks are definitely noteworthy. You know those web views that apps like Twitter fire up whenever you click on a link? They're now powered by Safari, so there's an added layer of continuity, meaning your saved passwords and the like will carry over into those app experiences. There's also a new formatting menu for Safari's reader that gives you seven additional font choices as well as new background colors if white tends to sear your eyes.

Safari的改动并不大，但是几项小的调整的确值得说下。你应该知道有些网页会在你点上面链接的时候自动弹出Twitter应用吧？（由于）这些（网页）都是由Safari处理的，所以苹果又给Continuity增添了新一层功能，可以让你网页上保存的密码直接传递到你的应用程序里（即在网页上登录后，从网页点链接跳转到相应应用里，应用会自动得到你网页的登录session——译者注）。此外，Safari的阅读器新增了格式菜单，你可以选择7种额外的字体还有不同的背景颜色——如果白色亮瞎你的狗眼的话。。

All told, though, Safari's most notable change lies under the hood. You can now banish ads from your web experience completely thanks to a cottage industry of content blockers that now live in the App Store, which may or may not completely change how publishers and content providers like us approach the mobile web depending on how big a deal they become. We can save the ethical discussion for another time; content blockers like Purity do a fine job stripping the web of additional cruft, which more than a few people will love.

总的来说，Safari最为显著的变动发生在光鲜亮丽的外表之下。由于民间自发开发的内容过滤器现在可以直接从AppStore获得，你现在可以完全地把广告从你的上网体验中清除干净了。这可能会（也可能不会）完全改变出版商和内容提供商（比如我们Engadget）利用移动互联网的方式——这得看广告过滤器造成的影响有多大了。道德问题讨论我们换个场合再进行。像Purity这种内容过滤器在去除网页上碍事东西的表现不错，这会赢得用户的广泛喜爱。

## Multitasking

**多任务**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/21051213d6e0183bfef923e97e7d4ba9/202673463/slideover-compressor.gif)

In years past, iOS has tended to cater to the needs of the iPhone -- hardly a surprise considering the huge gulf between the numbers of phones and iPads floating around out there. This time, though, iOS 9 is arguably more impressive on Apple's tablets, although your mileage will vary depending on the model you have.

在过去的多年中，iOS的设计都倾向于去满足iPhone的需要——考虑到手机和iPad在数量上的巨大差异，这点不该让人惊奇。但是这次，iOS9在苹果平板上的表现显然更令人印象深刻。——当然实际效果会依你的设备型号而定。

Anyway, Apple's push for efficiency is back in full-force on these big screens. A swipe over from the right side of the screen opens a drawer of apps you can run in tiny applet form when you need to do something quick without leaving the app you're already in. This feature is called Slide Over, and it's frankly how I spent most of my time while multitasking -- it's nice to be able to sift through an iMessage thread or refer to an email while I'm poking around in Safari and the experience is bound to get better once developers start cooking up apps to take advantage of this. This quick way to split focus between two apps will be good enough for most, so it's no wonder it's supported by the most iPads; Slide Over works on both generations of the iPad Air and the last three iPad Minis.

但不管怎样，苹果正在全力推动iOS在大屏幕上的效率（提升）。从屏幕右侧向左轻扫会打开你的“应用抽屉”，可以让你在“小部件”模式下运行应用，而不用离开你的当前应用。这个功能叫做slide over，而这正是我使用多任务时最频繁的打开方式。。能够在用Safari浏览网页时顺便扫视一条iMessage或者查看一条电子邮件真是不错。而我相信如果开发者们能够改动他们的应用来充分利用这一特性的话，用户体验一定会变得更好。这种将用户注意力分散到两个应用的快速方式对于大多数的应用是不错的，所以它被用到了到多数iPad上。slide over支持两代iPad Air以及最新三代iPad Mini。

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/a8656d44c020c4364ddb32ff33eb7efb/202681316/splitview.jpg)

If you need even more multitasking power, and you've got an iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4, say hello to Split View. As the name implies, you can drag the dividing line of one of those "applets" from Slide Over until it takes up a full 50 percent of your iPad's screen (see the handy GIF above). At this point you're running two apps side by side. You can interact with both halves simultaneously, too, as long as you don't require use of the keyboard. It's not always a perfect system, though. You might notice hints of jerkiness if you're fiddling with both apps at once (at least I did, on the iPad Mini 4). Also, this might just be me, but I wish I could run multiple instances of the same app; I really just want to have two Safari windows open at once so I can read while I read. Don't get me wrong: Split View is a lovely little feature and it's going to shine on [the new iPad Pro](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/09/ipad-pro-hands-on/), but it won't make sense all the time.

如果你还要继续压榨多任务的性能，而且你的平板是一台iPad Air2或者iPad Mini4，你就用分屏视图吧。顾名思义，你可以从slide over当中某个“小部件”的分割线处向外拖拽，直到那个应用占据了你iPad整个屏幕的一半（见以上动图），这时你可以并行运行两个应用。你可以同时操作两半屏幕，只要你不用键盘就行。但这毕竟不是一个完美的系统，如果你同时操作两个应用，你可能会遇到卡顿（至少我遇到了，我用的iPad mini 4）。呃这可能只是个例，但我希望我可以实现某个应用多开，我真的想同时开上两个Safari窗口，这样我就能同时看两个网页了。——别误会，我是说分屏视图是个很贴心的小功能，它在[新iPad Pro](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/09/ipad-pro-hands-on/)中会大显身手的，但是它并不总是有（必要）。

Picture-in-picture is exactly what it sounds like, and surprise: It's more helpful than it seems at first. When you're watching something using the stock Videos app, you can tap a new button in the bottom-right corner to shrink it to about a quarter of its original size. It's not going anywhere unless you want it to, meaning it hovers in the same spot on top of apps and the home screen until you flick it around to other corners. Need to give J.K. Simmons more room to breathe in **_Whiplash_**? Pinching to zoom out on that small window will bring it up to about half of the screen's width (and you can shrink his bloviating Fletcher character again with a double-tap). I love this feature already, but here's the thing: I have all of two movies in my Videos app so getting players like Netflix and YouTube on board with picture-in-picture would be a huge win for people with compatible iPads.

画中画——这功能正如其名。而令人惊喜的是，它比我第一眼看上去要有用得多。当你在用内置的视频应用看视频的时候，你可在画面的右下角按一个新的按钮，把它缩小到原大的四分之一大小。它不会四处活动，除非你（拖动）它，这意味着它会在应用或者主屏幕上方悬浮不动，除非你把它拖动到其他角上。如果想给Whiplash中的J.K.Simmons多腾点地方的话，用双指缩放可以把视频小窗口放大到宽是屏幕宽的一半大小（然后你可以双击小窗口将其恢复到原大）。我已经爱上了这项功能，而这个功能的重点在于，我在我的视频应用里有两个电影之后，把netflix和YouTube放成画中画模式，这对于有性能足够的iPad的用户来说，应该非常受用吧。

The keyboard got some major upgrades too, if not the ones you might expect. Beyond the visual feedback that comes with the improved Shift key, Apple threw in some context-sensitive shortcut buttons on top of the keyboard that (among other things) let you paste content with a single touch or format text when in appropriate apps. Of course, that's not to say iPads clearly got the better deal here. iPhones running iOS 9 get a low-power mode (as on newer Android builds) that disables background tasks and throttles down performance to keep the gadget going. It is, for lack of a better word, indispensable, and battery sizes aside, there's no reason why the iPads shouldn't have gotten this feature too. And the keyboard's pièce de résistance is a feature that's actually coming to the iPhone 6s, too: Plopping two fingers onto the keyboard causes the letters to fall away and turn into a trackpad for smoother cursor action. Where... where has this been all my life?

键盘也得到了些显著的改进，——如果不是你所期盼的那些的话。除了带视觉反馈的shift键之外，苹果在键盘的顶部放了些智能检测上下文的快捷键，它们可以让你在收支持的应用中只需要动一根手指就能粘贴内容或者设置段落格式。当然我不是说iPad在这点上做得就相对更好啊。运行iOS9的iPhone新增低电量模式——这有些像新版的Android——该模式禁用后台程序，降低设备性能，使得设备能继续工作。这实在是不可或缺的一项功能（再找不到其它合适的词了）。但是抛开电池容量不谈，iPad的确也需要这项功能。键盘还有一项重要功能——这项功能也来到了iPhone6s——两指在键盘上同时按下，键盘上的字会消失，键盘变成一个触控板，可以更为流畅地移动光标。。为啥。。为啥我就那么喜欢这个功能呢。。

## The Little Things

**小细节**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/ce79823029524af013666dd4020fd823/202682710/cursorgif.gif)

Beyond everything I've already discussed, Apple's made plenty of teensy tweaks that don't fall neatly into any one category, so I'm just going to stick them all here. The Podcasts app has gotten an overhaul with an Unplayed tab. Unlike other tech pontificators out there, I never had an issue with Apple's earlier implementations, but since we're in something of a podcasting renaissance, it's nice to see the company try to keep up with awesome third-party apps. I'm still not giving up Pocket Casts, though. You can now search for specific items inside the Settings app, making all the web's tutorials that much easier to follow.

除了我以上提到的种种之外，苹果还搞了不少的细节上的改动，这些改动并不能被严格地算到以上任何一个分类中，所以我把它们统一放这儿。Podcasts应用得到了重新设计，并新加了一个“从未播放”标签。我并不像其他科技保守派一样，我对苹果早前的（Podcasts应用）设计从未提出异议，但是由于我们正处在播客复兴的年代，所以我看到苹果尝试跟上一些不错的第三方应用的步伐，还是觉得很高兴的。但尽管如此，我还是不想就此放弃Pocket Casts。你现在可以在设置当中进行搜索，这使得网上的教程更容易执行了。

While you're in the settings, you can change that vibrate toggle on your iPhone to lock screen rotation instead (à la the iPad) and dig into the battery section for a full breakdown showing how badly some apps eat into your power reserves. You'll also get a better sense of who's behind random calls thanks to a location display in the Phone app; it'll match the area code to a known region in the US. If you don't feel like shelling out $99 for an Apple Developer account, no worries: You can sideload applications without one. You're also be given the option to install a separate iCloud Drive app so you can manage your selfies more easily. Speaking of selfies, Camera.app now saves photos taken with the front-facing camera in a separate "Selfies" folder (the same goes for screenshots, finally).

在设置当中，你可以把你iPhone上的“切换震动模式”选项改成“切换锁定竖屏”了（iPad也一样）。你还可以进入电池设置，亲眼看看有些应用是如何吞掉你的电量的；你还可以更好地了解是谁在给你打骚扰电话（就是响铃一下立刻挂断的那种——译者注），因为现在电话应用里有了（来电者）位置显示功能；它还会把区号和美国的相应地名做匹配。如果你不想花99美元获得一个苹果开发者账户的话也没关系，你可以不用开发者账户也可以旁加载应用程序了。你还可以选择另外安装一个iCloud Drive应用，这样你就能更容易地管理你的自拍照了。而说到自拍照，相机应用现在可以自动将前置摄像头拍的图片保存在一个叫“自拍”的相册里（截屏终于也有自己的相册了≡ω≡）

## Wrap-up

**总结**

![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f35265b416de73fd715a32cd7088d8b7/202682448/closer.jpg)

iOS 9 is a must-have update. That perhaps didn't need to be said considering it's the [fastest-adopted iOS update ever](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/21/ios-9-rapid-adoption-rate/), but the level of thoughtfulness and refinement here more than makes up for the lack of groundbreaking features. The tentpole features Apple we did get mostly work well, although it's not hard to see iOS 9 as Apple's attempt to keep up with [Android](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/03/android-m-developer-preview/). That's why the smaller, lower-level changes to iOS are so much more important this year: Apple has had its core features in place for ages now and iOS 9 works to connect them in subtler, more intuitive ways. Think of the new software as a layer of polish you may not have even realized iOS needed. More importantly, that polish strengthens iOS' foundation in preparation for the bigger, broader changes to come in future software updates.

iOS9算是必升的吧。也许不必说这话，因为这版iOS系统是[普及速度最快](http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/21/ios-9-rapid-adoption-rate/)的一版了。而新系统的细心设计和精心制作，不仅仅是对iOS最初缺乏的功能的补充。苹果新版系统的主要功能工作得都不错，虽然并不难看出iOS9是苹果在尝试追赶[Android](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/03/android-m-developer-preview/)。所以，今年iOS的这次小幅的底层更新和修缮比以往更为重要——这么些年以来，苹果系统的核心功能都已十分完善，而iOS9则使得它们联系的方式更为精细，更为直观。你可以把新系统想成是对之前系统的一次打磨——你甚至可能并未意识到iOS需要它。更重要的是，这样的打磨更加巩固了iOS的基础，使得iOS准备好在今后的系统更新中迎接更大、更广泛的变化。
