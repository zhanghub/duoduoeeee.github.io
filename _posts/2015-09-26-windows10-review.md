The best thing about Windows 10 is that it's simply Windows, through and through. It's as if Microsoft realized that devaluing the desktop in Windows 8 was akin to sacrilege, and Windows 10 is its penance. At its core, it's a union of the best qualities of [Windows 7](http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/12/windows-7-review/) and Windows 8 -- the desktop features of the former with some of the touch-friendly aspects of the latter. It's no wonder Microsoft is calling it an operating system that's both fresh and familiar. It's easy to use with a keyboard and mouse, but it's even better with touchscreen computers. The [Start menu](http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/windows-10-design/) is back! And new features like Microsoft's [Cortana virtual assistant](http://www.engadget.com/tag/cortana/) and [Edge browser](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-edge/) breathe new life into Windows. Microsoft is framing the OS as "Windows as a Service," meaning it's never quite done and constantly evolving. Most importantly, Windows 10 proves that Microsoft's dream of delivering a single OS that can work across computers, tablets and phones might actually come true.

关于Windows10，最棒的一点在于，它终于从头到脚只剩窗口了。看起来，微软意识到了在Windows8中低估桌面的价值无异于一种亵渎，而Windows10则是它的苦修。从其底层来讲，它是Windows7和Windows8的最佳特性的结合——前者的桌面特性和后者对于触控较为友好的某些方面。无怪乎微软将其称作“全新而熟悉”的操作系统。它很容易用键鼠操作，对于触屏电脑来说亦更好使用。[开始菜单](http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/windows-10-design/)强势回归！此外，一些新的特性，像是微软[小娜虚拟助理](http://www.engadget.com/tag/cortana/)和[Edge浏览器](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-edge/)也给Windows注入了新的生机。微软正将Windows10塑造成一项服务，这意味着它将永不满足，持续更新。更为重要的是，Windows10表明，微软带来一款能在电脑、平板和手机之间跨屏幕兼容系统的梦想，可能真的要实现了。

I don't blame Microsoft for trying to sacrifice some sacred cows with Windows 8. It's hard to truly innovate when you're tied to a decades-long history. And as far as operating systems go, Windows' interface is one of the oldest, with a core design that goes all the way back to 1995. But the real mistake with Windows 8 was that it was built for touch computing at a time when most people were still dealing with keyboards and mice (or trackpads). Adding insult to injury, it made the experience of using Windows worse for people without touchscreens. Now that touch-enabled laptops and multi-function devices like the Surface are more commonplace, Windows 8's touch innovations seem a lot more useful. But given the ill will that OS built up over the past three years, it also made sense for Microsoft to start fresh. (There's still no clear reason why Microsoft skipped the "Windows 9" name, but I like to think it was because it needed to distance itself from Windows 8 as much as possible.)

微软正在尝试牺牲一些Windows8中“不可动摇”的东西，在这点上，我并不责备它。要是背着几十年的历史包袱，一个人会很难做出真正的创新的。虽然操作系统一直在发展，但是Windows的界面是那种最老的，从1995年开始就一脉相承的设计。而Windows8最大的错误是，人们还在和键鼠以及触控板打交道的时候，它却专为触控计算而设计；而现在，触控笔记本和多功能设备（比如Surface）更为普及了，Windows8的触控方面的创新也更为有用了，但由于人们对Windows8这三年来的开发并无好感，微软也有必要重新开始。（微软为何跳过Windows9的名字，原因仍不明确，但我比较偏向认为是微软想让自己离Windows8越远越好。）

## Getting started

**上手体验**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+review+gallery+4.jpg)
Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of Windows 10, it's worth exploring the upgrade experience. In short, it's pretty painless! Gone are the days where we had to devote hours and enlist the help of Windows specialists just to upgrade to a new OS (or, in my case, be the one to get recruited). Microsoft has steadily made upgrading easier with Windows 7 and 8, but with Windows 10, the process is even smoother. If you're a current Windows user, you just need to click the "Get Windows 10" app in the system tray and click "Reserve Your Free Upgrade" to [join the queue](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade). If you don't see that app, make sure you have all of the current Windows Updates. Microsoft is making Windows 10 available to its [Insider testers first](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/02/windows-10-staged-rollout/) starting on July 29, so you might have to wait a bit before you can upgrade.

在深入Windows10本身之前，是值得看看升级win10过程体验如何的。一句话来说，完全无痛！我们之前为了升级一个系统不得不请Windows专家来耗费几个小时的日子一去不复返了！（或者是需要我受雇于你们的日子一去不复返了）。微软已经逐渐地使得更新Windows7和8不是那么难。而在Windows10中，这一过程甚至更为顺滑了。如果你现在是Windows用户，你只需要在系统托盘里点“获取Windows10”应用，再点“预定免费更新”就能[排上队了](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade).如果你找不见这个应用，你得保证你安装了现行的所有Windows更新。自7月29日起，微软让它的[内部测试人员（先行测试）](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/02/windows-10-staged-rollout/)。所以你可能得等一阵才能更新。

Most of us will just be upgrading right from within Windows, but you can also boot off an external hard drive or USB drive to get it going. The entire installation process takes anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your setup, and it's mostly hands-free.

我们中的大多数人应该会直接在Windows里完成升级，但你也可以从外置硬盘或者USB盘启动来安装Windows。根据你的设置，整个安装过程耗时20至40分钟不等，而且基本不需要你动。

Once your installation is complete, you're prompted to add in some personalization details and log in with your Microsoft Account. On a modern computer with a solid-state hard drive, Windows 10 typically boots within 10 to 15 seconds, about the same as Windows 7 and 8. (If you don't have an SSD yet, now is the time to make that upgrade!) The login screen will probably look no different to you. But if you've got a computer that supports [Windows Hello](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/17/windows-hello/) -- that is, one with a fingerprint sensor, eye scanner or infrared camera (like Intel's [RealSense 3D camera](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/intel-realsense/)) -- you can also log in almost instantly with biometric authentication. There aren't many Windows Hello-capable devices out there right now -- the few include the Dell Inspiron 15 5548, HP Envy 15t and Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 15 -- but from the demos we've seen, it looks like a logical evolution from just typing in passwords. Like many aspects of Windows 10, expect the mere act of logging in to get more intriguing over time.

安装过程完成之后，Windows会要求你设置个性化选项，并使用微软账户登录。在配备了固态硬盘的现代电脑上，Windows10基本上会在10至15秒内启动，大概与Windows7和8启动的速度相当。（如果你还没有固态硬盘，那是时候买一个了！）登录页看起来将没有什么不同，但是如果你买的电脑支持[Windows Hello](http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/17/windows-hello/)——意思是你的电脑有指纹识别器、眼部扫描器或者红外摄像头（比如英特尔的[RealSense 3D camera](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/intel-realsense/)）——你也可以使用生物识别技术立刻登录Windows。支持Windows Hello的设备现在没那么多，现有的包括Dell Inspiron 15 5548、HP Envy 15t和Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 15。但是从我们见到的演示来看，相比仅仅输入密码而言，它更像是逻辑上的创新。小小的登录举动会更加激起你对它的好奇心，这正如Windows10的很多其他方面一样。

If you've used any previous version of Windows, you'll be right at home with Windows 10. The desktop is once again front and center, rather than being shoved off to the side like it was in Windows 8. The Start menu replaces the blocky Start screen from Windows 8, which was one of the many reasons that kept users from upgrading. Even Windows 8's modern apps got something new: They can actually be used in their own windows! Before, they were either full-screen or took up a vertical slice of your display.

如果你用过之前任何一版Windows，那Windows10会让你宾至如归。桌面又一次来到了台前正中央，而不是像Windows8一样被推到屏幕的一侧。开始菜单取代了自Windows8以来方块状的开始屏幕，而开始屏幕则是使用户不愿升级到Windows8的诸多原因之一。Windows8的Metro应用也有了新技能：它们能真正地在窗口里用了。。之前它们要不是占着全屏，要不是竖着占着屏幕的一溜。

After spending the past few years with Windows 8, using Windows 10 felt like being thrown back into the past -- but in a good way. I never quite got used to the way the last OS treated keyboards and mice as an afterthought, and I've heard the same from plenty of other Windows power users. So you can imagine how satisfying it was to feel a return to Windows 7 levels of desktop productivity. For example, when you tap the Windows key on your keyboard, the Start menu pops up immediately. In Windows 8, it took a bit longer for the Start screen to appear. So now the simple task of hitting the Windows key and immediately typing to search for something -- one of the things I do most often -- feels significantly improved.

这几年我一直用的Windows8。现在用Win10，觉得自己被扔回了过去——但是以一种好的方式。对于前一版Windows处理鼠标键盘的方式，就好像鼠标键盘是开始没有，之后才加到电脑上的一样。我从大量别的Windows用户那里也听见了一样的抱怨，所以你可以想到，能够体验回到Windows7那样级别的桌面生产力，是一件多么让人满足的事情。比如，当你在键盘上按下Windows键时，开始菜单立刻弹了出来——在Windows8中，开始屏幕出现所需的时间更长一些。按一下Windows键，立刻可以敲字搜索——这是我常做的事情之一——体验显著改善了。

It wasn't long until I was back in my familiar Windows groove, with a desktop filled with multiple applications, browser tabs and random windows, all in a sort of ordered chaos. Being able to use modern apps in traditional windows is transformative. I used to avoid those apps entirely in Windows 8 since they were really meant for full-screen use, and they always felt like a huge waste of space on my 24-inch monitor. Full-screen apps make sense for tablets, but not so much for laptops and desktops. Now that I can actually move and resize modern apps on a whim, they suddenly feel more useful. Windows 10 also supports multiple desktops right out of the box, something that you had to download separately in earlier versions.

要不了多久，我就又回到了Windows熟悉的老套路。一个桌面，放满了很多应用、浏览器标签、各种窗口，都在“有组织的混乱”当中。能在传统桌面里用Metro应用这是一种变革。曾经在Windows8里我完全避免使用这些应用，它们在我24寸的显示器里简直是对屏幕空间的严重浪费，但是对笔记本和台式机来说不是那么浪费。现在，因为我能真正地按照我的意愿在屏幕上随意移动和改变Metro应用，觉得它们瞬间变得有用了。Windows还原生支持多桌面，这在之前的几版Windows中可都得分开下载。

Design wise, Microsoft stuck with the sharp corners and tile-like look it's been using since the debut of the Zune HD and Windows Phone, but there's also much more flair than Windows 7 and 8. The Start menu and settings menu (accessible by swiping in from the right side of the screen, or the notifications button in the system tray) feature a hint of transparency, while applications like the File Explorer are built out of clean lines and plenty of white space. The default dark theme felt a bit more mature than Windows 8, and you can also flip on an option that automatically pulls an accent color from your current desktop wallpaper. Overall, Windows 10 looks and feels modern yet welcoming, which is exactly the right balance Microsoft needs if it wants to appeal to everyone.

微软从发布Zune HD和Windows Phone开始就使用了锐利的边角以及磁贴的外观设计，而（win10中）这种设计相比Win7和win8来讲，还算比较有范的。开始菜单和设置菜单（设置可以从屏幕右侧向左轻扫，或者点击系统托盘里的通知按钮）都有一点点透明，而像文件管理器那样的应用则由清晰的线条和充足的空白空间所组成。这种默认的暗色主题比windows8感觉更为成熟，或者你也可以轻易开启一个选项，根据你当前的壁纸生成偏好颜色。总而言之，Windows10的外观看起来现代化且受人欢迎，这正是微软所需要的正确平衡——如果它想保持对公众的吸引力的话。

## Start menu, we missed you

**开始菜单，我们想死你了**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+review+gallery+1.jpg)

Like most of Windows 10, the Start menu's return should appease longtime fans and newcomers who are more used to Windows 8. It features your most-used applications (something resurrected from several Windows versions ago), and you can click through to get to all of your applications. But the bulk of the Start menu is made up of Live Tiles, those blocky icons Microsoft can't seem to get enough of. I didn't care for them much on the Windows 8 Start screen, but on Windows 10 they're more functional, especially since you don't need to completely leave your desktop to see them. Both the Live Tiles and the Start menu itself are customizable, so you can make them as small or as big as you'd like. At its largest, the menu is practically indistinguishable from the Windows 8 Start screen, but don't tell that to Windows 7 holdouts.

正如很多Windows10特性一样，开始菜单的回归应该能安抚那些更为习惯Windows8的骨灰级软粉和新用户。开始菜单上有你最常用的应用（有些老版windows里的应用，又在新版里得到了新生）。你可以一路用鼠标点击，查看全部的应用。而开始菜单里的各个大块是可以实时显示内容的磁贴，看来微软还没玩够磁贴啊。。在windows8里面我并不怎么关注它们，但是在Windows10中它们更能发挥作用了，尤其是，你并不一定必须得完全离开桌面就能看见它们。动态磁贴和开始菜单本身你都可以自行调整，缩小放大随你喜欢。最重要的是，win10开始菜单和win8的没什么两样——但是这可不要给那些windows7老用户说哦。

While it's a bit more work to find applications in the Start menu, I've honestly given up on the whole hunting and pecking thing. You're better off just hitting the Start button (or even better, the Windows key on your keyboard) and typing to bring up a specific program.

虽然在开始菜单找软件得稍稍多花一点点功夫，但是我的确再也不需要“一指禅”式地敲键盘了。简单地按下开始按钮（或者仅仅按下键盘上的windows徽标键）然后敲字，就能搜索出特定的应用来。

And what if you're the rare Windows 8 user who actually liked that Start screen? You can just switch over to that instead. Really, though, I'd suggest giving the new Start menu a shot, as it's far more useful than the Start screen in desktop mode.

那万一你是很少见的那种确实喜欢开始屏幕的Windows8用户呢？——你就把它切换成开始屏幕就行了嘛。的确是这样。但是我还是建议你试试新的开始菜单，它可比桌面下的开始屏幕有用多了。

## Continuum makes Windows more than meets the eye

**有了Continuum功能，Windows不仅仅是养眼**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+review+gallery+5.jpg)

One of the best things about Windows 10 is its ability to transform itself from a touch-focused platform to traditional desktop platform easily. Microsoft calls that feature "Continuum," because of the seamless transition between different work environments. It's really meant for multi-function computers like the Surface, which can be both a tablet and laptop depending on which accessories are connected. But it could also be useful if you want to connect a keyboard and mouse to your Windows 10 tablet. The tablet mode simplifies the taskbar, makes every application full-screen and enables a Windows 8-style Start screen. Windows 10 can automatically switch interfaces when it detects your keyboard has been removed, or you can choose to make the swap manually from the settings menu.

Windows10最棒的特性之一在于，它可以容易地从一个注重触摸功能的平台，变成传统的桌面平台。微软把这项特性叫做Continuum，是由于它能够从不同的工作环境无缝地切换。它就是为多用途电脑设计的——相是Surface——根据外设连接的不同，它可以是平板电脑或者是笔记本。如果你想给你的平板连接键盘鼠标的话，该功能也会有所助益。“平板电脑模式”会简化任务栏，令所有应用全屏运行，并启用Windows8样式的开始屏幕。当Windows检测到你的键盘被移除时，它会自动切换用户界面，或者你也可以从设置中选择手动切换。

Looking ahead, Continuum has the potential to completely change the way we compute. In early demos, Microsoft showed off how a Windows 10 phone can be [plugged into an external monitor](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/continuum-windows-10-phone/) -- either wirelessly or with an HDMI dongle -- and display a desktop-like interface. That could be a fun way to distract kids with videos when you're on vacation, but in the future when our phones get even more powerful, it could have an even bigger impact. It could mean the end of lugging around laptops for some people.

从长远来看，Continuum有潜力完全改变我们进行计算的方式。在早前的演示中，微软展示了windows10手机是如何能被通过无线或HDMI[连接到外部显示器](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/continuum-windows-10-phone/)，并显示一个桌面一样的界面。这可能是你度假的时候引开小孩注意力的一种有趣的方式，但是在未来当我们的手机越来越强大的时候，该功能还将会有更大的影响。对一些人来说，这可能意味着拖着笔记本到处跑的现状得以终结。

While testing Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3 over the past few months -- first with the preview builds and finally with the complete release -- I grew to appreciate Continuum as I moved between typical work tasks and more fun things, like reading digital comics with Comixology. It's certainly better than how Windows 8 handled the difference between tablets and traditional computers.

在过去的几个月里，我们在Surface Pro 3上测试Windows10的时候——先是预览版，再是最后的完整版——我渐渐地开始欣赏Continuum——当我从典型的工作任务切换到偏向娱乐性的任务（比如用Comixology阅读电子漫画）。这种处理平板和传统电脑区别的方式，的确比Windows8来得要好。

##Cortana brings virtual assistants to the desktop

**小娜，虚拟助手放桌面**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+review+gallery+2.jpg)

Okay, virtual assistants are nothing new these days, but Cortana brings plenty of notable features to Windows 10. While setting it up, you can choose to have Cortana always listen for your commands (enabled by saying "Hey Cortana!"). You can ask her about basic things like the current weather or what's on your schedule, or you could have her search the web using Bing. Cortana can answer some queries without even launching a web browser (you wouldn't believe how old Tom Cruise really is). If you're not a fan of voice commands, you can also type in queries into the Cortana search box on the taskbar, and you can choose to have her only activate voice commands when you hit a button.

好吧，现在这年头，虚拟助理早已不是什么新鲜事物，但Cortana为Windows10带来了大量的有意思的功能。在设置的时候，你可以选择让Cortana始终等待你的命令启动（就是说“嘿，Cortana”启动Cortana）。你可以问他基本的问题，比如当前的天气或者你有什么日程安排，或者让他用必应搜索网页。Cortana可以在不打开浏览器的情况下响应一些请求（你不敢相信汤姆·克鲁兹多大了）。（见图）如果你不是那么喜欢语音控制的话，你还可以在任务栏上的Cortana搜索栏中打字，还可以设置让Cortana仅在你按下某个键时才激活语音指令。

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+screenshots++2.jpg)

If you're worried about having Cortana always listening for your commands, perhaps over latent fears about AI taking over the world, I'd suggest getting over it. Cortana's true strength, much like Alex on Amazon's Echo, is her ability to handle voice commands at any moment. If you're in the middle of a work document, for example, you can tell Cortana to set a quick reminder or look something up without interrupting your workflow. Siri requires manual activation, unless your iOS device is plugged in, and while Google Now has become more widely available for voice commands on Android phones, it's still not as reliable as an always-on assistant.

如果你担心Cortana一直聆听你的指令（可能是出于对人工智能统治世界的恐慌），我建议你克服这种恐慌。Cortana真正的力量，更像是亚马逊Echo里的Alex一样，就是它在任何时候处理语音指令的能力。比如，如果你正在写工作文档，你可以让Cortana设置一个快捷提醒或者在不打断你工作进度的前提下联网搜索。Siri需要手动打开，除非你的iOS设备连着电源；而虽然Google Now在安卓手机里被广泛用于语音指令，但它还是不如一个常开的语音助手来得可靠。

Inspired by actual assistants, Microsoft also gave Cortana a notebook that contains all of your personal preferences. Many of them she learns over time, but you can also hop straight into the notebook and tell Cortana things like your food preferences, and what sort of restaurant you prefer. All of that will help her return more personalized answers for future queries. Cortana is also part of Microsoft's plan to bring its services to all of your devices: Microsoft is bringing it to Android soon and iOS eventually, and in each case the app will include Cortana's notebook of your preferences.

受到现实生活中的助手启发，微软给Cortana配备了一个“记事本”，它包括你全部的个人（使用）偏好。这当中很多是Cortana随着时间推移学习的，而你也可以直接进到它的“记事本”里，直接告诉它比如你喜欢吃什么或者你喜欢什么类型的餐厅。这些都会有助于它在今后的请求中向你提供更为私人化的信息。Cortana也是微软计划的一部分，以把微软的服务带到你的全部设备上——微软会很快带来Android版，最终会有iOS版。每个版本的应用都会有Cortana的偏好记事本。

Cortana handles voice commands about as well as Siri and Google Now. It's pretty accurate when it comes to recognizing your voice input (although that also depends heavily on the quality of your microphone), and in many cases it even fetched more useful results than Siri. It's not nearly as preemptive with information as Google's offering, though. That assistant is smart enough to warn me when I should leave for my next meeting, or when my latest Amazon orders have arrived. Those are things we'll eventually see on every virtual assistant, but at the moment Google Now remains the smartest one overall, even if it's not much of a conversationalist. Cortana is the most human-sounding assistant; so there's that.

Cortana处理语音指令几乎与Siri和Google Now一样好。它识别语音输入相当精确（虽然这也跟你麦克风的质量有重要关系），而且在很多情况下，它获取的结果比Siri的更有用。尽管如此，它还是比不上谷歌提供信息的先发制人的优势。Google Now很聪明，会提醒我什么时候该出发去下一个会议，或者我的亚马逊包裹来了。——这些是我们终将在所有的语音助手上见到的功能，但是现在总的来说，Google Now是目前最智能的一个，哪怕它现在只是一个“对话列表”。而Cortana的声音是目前听起来最像人的。就是这样。

## Edge: Sayonara, Internet Explorer

**Edge浏览器：向IE说再见**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+screenshots++3.jpg)

If you ever wanted Microsoft to just give up on Internet Explorer and create a web browser from scratch, Edge may be just what you're looking for. It forgoes all of the legacy protocols, like ActiveX, that turned Internet Explorer into a slow and insecure beast. And it takes a few lessons from Google's Chrome with a minimalist style and speedy browser engine. In fact, I ended up preferring Edge to Chrome in my testing, mainly because Google's browser has become a major memory hog over the years.

如果你曾经想让微软放弃IE，从头再做一个浏览器的话，那Edge可能正恰恰是你想要的。它放弃了所有老式的协议（比如ActiveX会把IE变成一个缓慢而不安全的怪兽）。它也从谷歌Chrome学习借鉴，使用了极简的外观和快速的浏览器引擎。事实上，在测试中，我最终更喜欢Edge而不是Chrome，主要是这些年谷歌浏览器内存占用得太多了。

Edge may be the most elegant piece of software to come from Microsoft. Its interface is simple: tabs on the top; back, forward and refresh buttons below; and an address bar. The latter is smarter than other browsers as it also features Cortana (without the voice commands). You can type in questions and often get them answered right within Edge's location bar -- no need to hit Enter to complete your search. That's something Google has been dabbling with in Chrome, but Edge takes it to another level.

Edge怕是微软推出的最优雅的一款软件了。它的界面很简单，顶上是标签页，标签页下面是后退、前进以及刷新键，以及一个地址栏。Edge比其他浏览器更为智能，因为它还集成Cortana（但是不带语音控制）。你可以在里面输入问题，在Edge的“位置”栏中直接得到回答，而不需要再按enter完成搜索。这东西Google Chrome一直在搞，但Edge将其升到了一个全新的高度。

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/screenshot-3-1.jpg)

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/screenshot-4-1.jpg)

You can manage your Favorites, Reading List entries (articles you save to read later), History and Downloads from Edge's Hub, which mostly stays out of the way until you need it. Microsoft also gave Edge annotating capabilities: You can highlight and mark up web pages any way you like (the Surface's stylus comes in handy for this) and send them off to Evernote with just a few clicks. Those marked-up pages also retain your notes when you visit them again.

你可在Edge的Hub里管理你的收藏夹、阅读列表入口（存档供稍后阅读的文章）、历史记录和下载列表——你不需要的时候，这些东西不会出来挡道。微软还给Edge开发了原笔迹功能，你可以随心所欲地给任何网页做高亮和标记（Surface的触控笔做这些很方便），再轻点几下鼠标，将其发到Evernote。那些被标记的网页也会保存你的笔迹，下次你访问的时候还可以显示。

## A much better Xbox app

**改进了Xbox应用**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+screenshots++4.jpg)

While the Xbox app was a decent way to stay connected to your gaming friends in Windows 8, now it's actually useful for gaming. Windows 10 can stream games from any Xbox One on your home network (and eventually [Xbox 360 games that are compatible](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/17/xbox-360-game-streaming-windows-10/)) -- all you need to do is plug an Xbox One controller into your PC and hit the streaming button on the Xbox app. The games still run on your Xbox One; it's just spitting out a real-time video feed to your computer rather than just your TV. As you can imagine, such a feature requires pretty strong network capabilities, so I'd recommend plugging either your Xbox or computer into Ethernet (ideally both) to use it. Streaming over WiFi is possible, but even with a strong router, I ran into issues testing out this feature.

Xbox虽然在Windows8中是和你好友联机对战的好方式，但是在Windows10当中，它终于可以真正地用来打游戏了。。Windows10可以从你家家庭网络里的任何Xbox one流媒体接收游戏（？？）（最终会支持所有[兼容Windows10的Xbox360游戏](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/17/xbox-360-game-streaming-windows-10/)）,你要做的一切就是把Xbox手柄插入Windows10电脑，再在Windows10的Xbox应用上按下“流媒体”键。游戏仍然在你的Xbox One上运行，只是Xbox向你的电脑（而不仅仅是电视）发送实时流媒体视频。正如你所想象的那样，这种功能对网络承载力的要求相当高，所以我建议，把你的Xbox或者电脑连上有线以太网（最好是两个都连上）使用这个功能。通过WiFi传送也是可以的，但是我测试这个功能的时候还是出现了问题，哪怕用的是很健壮的路由器。

My Surface Pro 3 refused to hold a stream for more than a few seconds (I think it may not be playing nicely with my 5GHz 802.11n wireless network), while my desktop gaming PC (also connected to my 5GHz N network with a large external antenna) handled it just fine. I was able to race in Forza Horizon 2 and play some Destiny matches with the same amount of control as I had on the Xbox One. There are some video artifacts, and the connection occasionally cut out, so it's not ideal for truly important gaming scenarios. Still, these are early days, and I can imagine Microsoft will continue to optimize how Windows 10's game streaming works on typical home networks. If you've got a high-end AC router, you'll probably have fewer issues.

我的Surface Pro 3流媒体连上了几秒就断开了（我想这个功能和我的5GHz 802.11n无线网不能愉快地玩耍），但是我的桌面游戏电脑上（用的是一个大的外接天线，也连的我的5GHz n无线网）这个功能表现尚可。我可以在Forza Horizon 2中开赛车，打Destiny的匹配，就像我在Xbox One上的玩法一样。画面有时候有点点失真，连接偶尔会断开，所以这种方式对于真正重要的游戏场景并不理想。但这还是这项技术的早期。我能想到微软会继续优化Windows10的游戏流媒体在典型的家庭网络环境下的表现。如果你有一台高端AC路由器，你的问题应该不会那么多。

The Xbox app also serves as a single hub for all of the games on your computer; it even managed to find Broken Age, which I installed via Steam, and you can manually add games as well. You can also start a party chat with people on your friends list, as well as share clips from your Game DVR library on Xbox Live. Overall, it's simply a much more functional offering than the Windows 8 Xbox app.

Windows10的Xbox应用还可以是你电脑上的所有游戏的中枢，它甚至成功地找到了我用Steam安装的Broken Age，你还可以手动添加游戏。你可以与你的好友列表里的好友进行群聊，还可以分享你Xbox Live游戏录屏库里的片段。总之，Windows10的新版Xbox比windows8里的Xbox

## Other apps

**其它应用**

Windows 10 also features redesigned versions of core apps, like Mail, Calendar, Maps and the Windows Store. They all adopt the minimalist aesthetic from Windows 10, but what's really interesting about them is that they're universal apps, meaning they're the exact same apps that will run on Windows 10 phones later this year. We're still waiting to see how third-party developers latch onto Microsoft's universal apps -- those that can be written once and run across multiple devices -- but the company has at least proven they're possible with Windows 10.

windows10还具备了重新设计的核心（预装）应用，比如邮件、日历以及Windows商店。新的应用全面适配了windows10的简约审美观。而真正有趣的是它们都是通用应用，意思是它们在今年晚些时候发布的Windows10手机上运行的版本是完全一样的。我们仍在观察第三方开发者将会如何跟进微软的通用应用——写一次代码，然后在多个平台上运行——而微软至少已经证明了windows10下，这是可能实现的。

Apps were a big focus at Microsoft's [Build developer conference](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/02/build-2015-windows-10/), and for good reason. One of Windows 8's big issues was that it didn't attract a healthy developer community like iOS and Android, even though Microsoft has been talking about the idea of universal apps even before that OS launched. To that end, Microsoft also announced that developers will be able to [recompile](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/android-ios-apps-on-windows-10/) their iOS and Android apps to work on Windows 10. In fact, that's how King brought Candy Crush Saga over to Windows. There are also new developer tools for iOS and Linux, so developers don't even need to run Windows to build Windows apps.

[微软开发者大会](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/02/build-2015-windows-10/)上，应用是一个重要的焦点，这很好。windows8的很多大问题之一在于，它并未像iOS和Android一样吸引一个健康的开发者社区，即使微软在系统实际开始开发之前就开始谈论“通用应用”了。为了达到（多开发应用）的目的，微软还宣布开发者可以[重编译](http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/29/android-ios-apps-on-windows-10/)他们的iOS和Android应用，让它们在windows10上工作。实际上，King就是使用这种方法，将Candy Crush Saga移植到windows上的。微软还开发了iOS平台和Linux平台上的开发者工具，这样，开发者甚至不需要运行windows就能开发windows应用了。

As for those new Windows 10 apps, they all look and function better than their Windows 8 counterparts. Mostly, that's because you can actually run them in traditional windows. The Mail and Calendar apps, in particular, are good enough that I'll likely be sticking with them for the time being. They're fast, relatively lightweight and attractive -- the sort of thing you normally had to rely on non-Microsoft developers to create. The News app is also more useful than I thought it would be. It's basically Microsoft's spin on news readers like Feedly, except built right into the OS. News did a decent job of alerting me to interesting tidbits, like when NASA discovered an [Earth-like exoplanet](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/23/nasa-kepler-452b/), and even without much training it highlighted news it knew I would be interested in.

至于那些新的windows10应用，它们在windows10上的表现也比windows8上的同版，无论是从外观上，还是从功能上都要好。这主要是因为你的确可以让它们在传统窗口里运行了。特别是“邮件和日历”应用，好得以至于我决定暂时就用着它了。windows10的应用，运行速度快，相当的轻量且具有吸引力——这些软件你之前得依靠非微软的开发者提供。“新闻”应用也比我想象的更为实用。它更像是Feedly这样的新闻阅读器的微软变种——除了它是直接内建在系统里面的之外。新闻应用成功地将我的兴趣转为了有趣的花边新闻，像NASA发现了[太阳系外的类地行星](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/23/nasa-kepler-452b/)之类的。而且它并没怎么学习就自动标出了它认为我感兴趣的新闻。

The upgraded Windows Store app also makes it much easier to locate and install new apps. Again, since you're not forced to navigate it in fullscreen, you can actually use it without completely disrupting your workflow. It feels more like Apple's Mac Store app now, which is a huge improvement over Windows 8. Many Windows users still have to get used to the notion of using an app store to find software, and this redesigned Store app goes a long way towards making that happen.

升级版的windows商店也使得寻找和安装应用更为方便。同样，因为你再也不用被迫在全屏状态下浏览它，所以你用它的时候也不会完全打断你的工作进度。现在它更像是苹果的Mac AppStore，这是（windows10相较于）windows8的一个重大改进。很多windows用户还不习惯用应用商店来找应用的这一概念，而windows应用商店要更新人们的观念，还得有很长的路要走。

## Pricing and system requirements

**价位和系统要求**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+screenshots++1.jpg)

Microsoft surprised everyone when it announced that it would be giving away [Windows 10 for free](http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/windows-10-free-upgrade/) (specifically for existing Windows 7 and 8 users). It showed that, for once, it was more interested in getting people to use Windows than it was in forcing people to pay for yet another upgrade. Instead, Microsoft made it clear that it was far more important to actually get people on Windows 10, which would make it a more viable platform for developers, as well as a gateway to its many online services. Windows 10 is more than a piece of retail software; it's the basis of Microsoft's future Windows empire.

微软宣布它会[免费提供windows10](http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/windows-10-free-upgrade/)（特别是对现有的windows7和8的用户），给了所有人一个惊喜。这表明，破天荒地，微软对于吸引用户来使用windows比迫使人交钱购买另一个升级版更感兴趣了。相反的，微软声称，实际让人们用上windows10要远远重要得多。这一举措可以使得windows10变成一个更适合开发者使用的平台，同时成为微软丰富在线服务的入口。windows10不仅仅是一个零售软件，而是微软今后windows王朝的基石。

After that first year, Windows 10 Home will cost $120, while the Pro version will go for $200. I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft ends up extending its free offer even further though, especially if Windows 10 really ends up taking off. As usual, the Home version of Windows 10 is the one meant for most consumers, while the Pro version adds advanced features like Active Directory support. There are also editions meant for [enterprise users and schools](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/13/windows-10-versions/), and of course we'll see it hit mobile devices later this fall. (Side note: Microsoft also removed Windows Media Center in Windows 10, so be prepared for that shocker if you actually used it.)

一年免费之后，windows10家庭版将会作价120美元，而专业版将会作价200美元。如果微软到时延长免费期限，我也并不惊奇，特别是万一windows10到时真的火了呢。如以前一样，windows10家庭版主要为消费者使用，而专业版具有高级功能，比如活动路径支持。此外还有[为企业用户和学校准备的版本](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/13/windows-10-versions/)。当然我们在今年晚些，秋季时会看见windows10登陆移动设备。（批注：在windows10中，微软还去除了媒体中心，如果你真的用那玩意的话，你得准备承受打击了。。）

As far as basic requirements go, Windows 10 is pretty much the same as Windows 8: You'll need at least a 1GHz processor and 1GB of RAM (2GB for the 64-bit version), as well as 16/20GB of free hard drive space for the 32-bit/64-bit editions. Basically, just about anyone can run Windows 10. You can't buy a computer these days that doesn't meet those specs.

而至于基本配置，windows10和8基本是一致的：32位版本要求最低处理器主频1GHz，内存1GB，64位版本要求内存2GB；两者都要求16~20GB的硬盘空间。基本上任何人都能用上windows10，你现在买电脑也买不到低于这个配置的了。

## Wrap-up

**总结**

![](https://o0stweauh.qnssl.com/Windows+10+review+gallery+6.jpg)

I had [high hopes for Windows 10](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/02/build-2015-windows-10/) after Microsoft's Build conference, where I noted that, for once, the company was acting as a leader, not a follower. Windows 10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile. Heck, it makes the Xbox One a more useful machine.

在微软开发者大会上我得知，微软这次扮演着领导者角色，而不是一个跟随者。我对windows10[抱有很高的期望](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/02/build-2015-windows-10/)。windows10带来了微软最为精致的桌面体验，而且事情远远不止如此。他还是一个成功的平板系统，它为将来混合设备的天下做足了准备。这次它不再是一坨令人困惑的翔，而是向移动设备领域前进的一大步。天哪，它真的使得Xbox One更加实用了。

It's nice, for once, to be able to recommend a new version of Windows without any hesitation. If you've got a Windows 7 or 8 machine, there's no reason not to take advantage of Microsoft's free upgrade offer. And if, for some reason, you have a machine that's older than Windows 7, Windows 10 is good enough to justify getting a new computer.

头一次能够毫不犹豫地推荐一个新版的windows，真好。如果你的机器是windows7或者8，那你没有理由不好好利用下微软的免费升级。而如果出于某些原因，你用的电脑比windows7还老，那windows10的诸多好处足以让你下定决心买一台新电脑。
