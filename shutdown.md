I have made up my mind to shut down my microblog site for quite a while and concentrate on something more interesting. The related services on the target server has been shut down.

When to restart the site remains unclear. Besides, my social media such as QZone, Twitter, etc will have far less frequent updates.

Live is offline; Life is beautiful.
