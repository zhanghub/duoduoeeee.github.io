	<h1 class="page-title">Do great things</h1>
	<p class="lead">We all get the same 24 hours.
	<p class="lead">So put aside your fears.
	<p class="lead">And don’t wait until someday.
	<p class="lead">Because actions always speak loudest.
	<p class="lead">And doing is how you say to the world, “this is me.”
	<p class="lead">Do great things.</p>
