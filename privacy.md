Just relax! I give all of you my word that pages in my website never include any method of tracking your activities. Besides,there is no alttext attached to the photos I include in my site so that these photos are not indexed by search engines.

The only cookie I'm mentioning is from Cloudflare, which provides DNS parsing services while offers secure https connections and that's definitely safe. You may refer to [this page](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-) for a clear explanation by Cloudflare.

While I translate passages there might be resources from outside that include cookies. I'd like to keep all the photos, videos and things like that directly inside GitHub, but that could be a heavy burden for me because my GitHub site only offers 1 GB of storage.

I once thought about adding Google Analytics or Baidu Analytics to my site -- just out of curiosity about what you are doing on my site and what computers and browsers you are using but I quickly gave up this thought because I believe that respecting everyone's privacy is what should be in everybody's mind and that privacy is something that should never be public or it couldn't be called so. Thus, just relax and enjoy pure content without any annoyance or disturbance.
