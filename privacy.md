title: Privacy Statement

After thinking about my policies I've made up my decision to remove all means of analytic scripts. You may check out my source code if you are willing to. Enjoy free and pure online privacy without worrying!

I've always dreamed of an internet that is free of surveillance and spying without our knowing or consent. I believe that every web administrator, big or small, should make contributions to this great cause because this is of course of public interest and we could make a difference as long as we unite together.

If you want to read the source of my html to verify whether I am telling the truth, you may see the `head.html` file under `/_includes` folder. Or you may simply fire up your F12 developer tool in your browser.

Thank you!
