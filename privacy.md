My website features https because I'd like to bring about a better and more secure experience for you users. While this time my site features **Tencent Analytics**. For a clearer explanation,please visit its website at <ta.qq.com>.

At first I thought about using Google Analytics. But on taking the domestic online environment into consideration,I ended up using Tencent. But you may relax, since the analytics script transfers under <font color=green>secure https connection</font>.

Tencent analytics collects information including (but may not be
limited to):

- Total Page views count daily
- Individual IPs count daily
- Individual user count daily
- **User count per city**
- Rank of pageview count
- Pageview depth(To rank about how many pages on my site are accessed by a user)
- Average duration of users staying on my pages
- **Maybe your gender**(I don't know how's that possible)
- Your ISP. ([What is an ISP?](http://baike.baidu.com/subview/855/5889203.htm))
- **Information about your operating system.** Including:
 - Name of your operating system. For instance: Windows
 - Your browser name. For instance: Firefox
 - Your flash version. For instance: 11
 - Your screen resolution. For instance: 1366*768
 - Whether Java is supported. For instance: Yes
 - Your timezone settings. For instance: 北京
 - Your platform information. For instance: x11 (A platform information indicates what kind of device you are using. This often refers to the architecture of a device.)
- **Real time visitor details.** Including:
 - Access time
 - Your city
 - Whether you are a new visitor
 - Incoming source(external link,search engines,direct access,etc.)
 - How long you are staying on one of my pages.

I'd appreciate it if you understand my policy-just relax because I'm just out of curiousity and wouldn't do anything illegal,improper or unethical to your information.
